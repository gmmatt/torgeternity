      content: "<p>The Basic Rules compendim contains a condensed set of rules for Torg Eternity and a description of how to play the game in Foundry VTT. In some cases, these rules simplify concepts from the original game. To play with a full set of rules, and all of the most essential data for the game, you can purchase the Core Rules Module. Whenever these rules conflict with the Core Rules, you should follow the Core Rules.</p><h2>Storm Knights</h2><p>In Torg Eternity, each player character is a @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#storm-knights]{Storm Knights}. The Archetypes compendium contains sixteen different characters that can be used for play using the basic rules.</p><h2>The Invaders</h2><p>Adventures in Torg Eternty are played out in the months following the invasion of Earth by the High Lords. Each High Lord commands a reality that is dramatically different from our own. These realities are called \"Cosms.\" Each Cosm has its own unique @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#reality]{Axioms and World Laws}.</p><h2>Skill Tests</h2><p>The core mechanic is Torg Eternity is the skill test. See @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#skill-and-attribute-tests]{Skill and Attribute Tests} for details on how to make a skill or attribute test in the Torg Eternity system for Foundry.</p><h2>Cards</h2><p>Torg Eternity uses three different types of cards during play:</p><ul><li>@UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#drama-cards]{Drama Cards} are used during turn-based play to determine the order in which the characters act and to introduce different circumstances in each round of play.</li><li>@UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#destiny-cards]{Destiny Cards} are used by players to alter skill tests and change the narrative of play.</li><li>@UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#cosm-cards]{Cosm Cards} are used by players to trigger events that are unique to each cosm.</li></ul><p>For details on how to manage your hands and decks in Foundry, see @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#managing-cards]{Managing Cards}.</p><h2>Acts, Scenes, and Rounds: How Torg Eternity Games are Structured</h2><p>Torg Eternity is played out in a series of Acts and Scenes. As a rule, a single Act is played out in each session of Torg Eternity. Each Act is comprised of two or more Scenes, and each Scene is considered to be either Standard or Dramatic. Whether a scene is Standard or Dramatic can impact some of the mechanics of play, particularly during turn-based play. When playing a pre-generated adventure, the text of the adventure will indicate whether a particular scene should be treated as Standard or Dramatic.</p><p>In some situations, including @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combat]{Combat} and @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#dramatic-skill-resolution]{Dramatic Skill Resolution}, structured, a more structured, turn-based set of rules will apply.</p><h2>Session Zero</h2><p>Because we want you and your players have a good time playing\_<em>Torg Eternity</em>, we have included the @UUID[.351aQbej1BLlJwOd]{Session Zero} PDF into the system. Have fun playing!</p><h2>Data Elements</h2><p>For the techies out there, you can find the data elements here: @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#data-elements]{Data Elements}</p>"

      content: "<div class=\"directive1\" style=\"margin:0rem 6rem\"><h4>Hello!</h4><p>Just wanted to let you know this booklet has a different tone and approach than our regular source material. It is not a formal reference document.</p><p>Imagine we are sitting down at a bar or restaurant at a convention, and you have asked, “Hey, what should I talk about with my players before running Torg Eternity?”</p><p>We answer that question, right after some definitions on the facing page.</p><p>Each section starts telling you who is talking to you for that section, then we dive right in.</p></div><h1>Session Zero</h1><p>Greg Gorden here. When holding a Session Zero the first thing to do is take a deep breath and relax. You are talking with your friends about how to keep your Torg Eternity sessions fun, not negotiating a trade deal with China. And if you are negotiating a trade deal with China, please invite me to a session where you run a PanPacifica adventure. I would love to see that.</p><div class=\"sidenote right\"><h4>Terms and Techniques</h4><p>Every reality in Torg Eternity depicts evil, from the Living Land’s savagery, to Aysle’s Darkness and conquest, to the Nile Empire’s nefarious villains, to Orrorsh’s diabolical creatures of the night. But some topics can make players or the GM feel uncomfortable. The well-being of the players should take precedence over the story, plot, or attempts at “accuracy.”</p><p>There are a few well-established tools which can help Game Masters ensure a successful session that can be enjoyed by all at the table.</p><h3>Session Zero</h3><p>Before the game, correspond or meet to discuss expectations. Go over the play style and potential themes that could arise to make sure all parties are on the same page. Suggesting a movie rating (PG, PG-13, etc.) is one way to establish and compare expectations. It can be helpful to meet oneon-one to ensure confidentiality and prevent pressure. This booklet covers Session Zero topics specific to the Cosms of Torg Eternity.</p><h3>Lines and Veils</h3><p>This technique allows the Game Master and player to create boundaries. Go over possible content, such as those mentioned above, and place behind a line those things which shouldn’t show up in the game at all and behind a veil those things which are okay “off camera”—existing in the world but not happening directly to or near the characters. This technique is the primary one we will be using in this booklet.\_\_</p><h3>The X-Card</h3><p>This method, invented by John Stavropoulos, is a visual or auditory signal (maybe even an actual card) that the player can use to signal whenever something in the story is making him or her uncomfortable. Without comment or critique, the Game Master immediately alters, rewinds, or skips ahead in the story to remove that element. You can read more about X-Cards at http:// tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg. This technique is not cosm specific, so the group just needs to agree on its use.\_</p><h3>Check-Ins and Session Aftercare</h3><p>During the session, and especially during particularly gory or frightening scenes, the Game Master should pause to quickly check in with the players and see if they are okay to continue. And after the session, the Game Master should individually check with each player to see how they feel about that session’s content, then shape future sessions accordingly.\_</p><p>There are many other methods, and some will work better for certain groups. The key is to make sure everyone at the table feels safe, supported, and comfortable during every session. If a player expresses discomfort, they should be under no pressure to explain or justify their feelings.</p></div><p>While we will focus mostly on problematic areas each cosm may present, remember that a Session Zero is also a time to talk about what your players hope to do and see in their adventures. It is a time to tell your players what sort of adventure you like to run, whether you are running one-shots or an extended campaign.</p><p>I often hold my Session Zeroes over snacks or a casual meal. Even with the COVID pandemic, I ask people to bring beverages and munchies to enjoy while we talk about the upcoming game. This is not an inquisition, its a conversation.</p><p>When discussing lines and veils, I like to draw three distinct types of interactions to decide where we want to set the line, and what we want to show or act out at the table:</p><ul><li>NPC with NPC</li><li>NPC with Storm Knight</li><li>Storm Knight with Storm Knight</li></ul><p>I ask that NPC/Storm Knight limits be commutative. That is if a Storm Knight can do Action X on an NPC, then NPCs can do Action X on a Storm Knight. Storm Knights do not get to prey upon NPCs in ways that the NPCs can never employ against the Storm Knights.</p><p>Lets say I plan an adventure arc set in Orrorsh where a key plot element is cult kidnappings of children for sale, indoctrination or sacrifice. Members of my current group would probably say that arc crosses a line for them. No amount of “off camera” activity can make them comfortable gaming out that subject matter at our table. So I shelve that idea.\_</p><p>Some other time I may have an arc that includes a Russian criminal organization that furthered Psychic Institute research into mind control, developing a drug that greatly increases the odds of mind controlling Race, humans, and Tharkoldu alike. For the arc to work at all, I need to give NPCs the ability to mind control other NPCs. If the players want their Storm Knights to have a chance to use the drug to control a Technodemon, then they have to accept the chance that an NPC might try to mind control their Storm Knight. It is a package deal, whichever package they choose.</p><p>If some of the players are comfortable with the through of allowing mind control, but others are not, don’t allow it.</p><p>Personally, I am not comfortable participating in games where a player at the table can mind control the character of another player, so I would say that crosses the line for <em>me</em>. I am certainly not running that game.</p><p>Speaking of Tharkold (and it is one of the cosms that has plenty of content that could make players twitchy) the levels of gory violence are something that could be negotiated with veils as well as lines. If the group is really uncomfortable with gore, then Tharkold may not be a cosm in which you want to run your sessions. But you and your group may be comfortable with allowing most of the violence to occur “off camera,” ending a scene with a description of an upraised claw and a pained wail rather than describe the Technodemon’s slaughter of her thrall. Just talk through some scenes and find out where your group’s comfort level is.</p><h1>Aysle</h1><p>Hey there, it’s Brian Reeves. You might know me from such hits as <em>Fires of Ra</em> and <em>Revenge of the Carredon</em>. Aysle embraces familiar fantasy tropes, from dragons to monster-filled catacombs to wizardry, but with a dash of real-world European legends and Grimm’s fairy tales. Despite the popularity of these tropes in the tabletop RPG hobby, they might still be troubling to some players. Here are some of the topics I suggest discussing before running an adventure in Aysle.</p><h3>Vikings</h3><p>In our world, these sea raiders gained a reputation for violent raids, rape, murder, and slavery. Wanton killing of non-combatants is certainly in the wheelhouse of Ayslish Vikings, but can be tough for some to take. Consider discussing how the members of your group might respond to having their characters witness (or stumble upon the aftermath of) such acts. The death of children can be even more upsetting, and is not necessary to underscore the ferocity of Ayslish Vikings. Similarly, the depredations of Ayslish Vikings need not extend to sexual violence. This is an extremely common linecrosser for gaming groups, even when conducted “off screen;” best to avoid it entirely. A Viking raid can still be terrible if the attackers simply slay some guards, burn some crops, and steal everything that can fit on their longboat—leaving the innocents alive and well, if destitute.</p><h3>Slavery</h3><p>This leads me to the touchy topic of slavery. Forcing captives into brutal labor is supported by the Social Axiom, though it is recognized as an evil act, and is common only among the armies of the Dark. Slavery can show up in many ways in fantasy. In adventures I’ve played in the past, it has appeared as grubby gnomes chained at the ankle while they haul blocks from a quarry, as magically-enthralled warriors forced to fight for their enemy, as women imprisoned in an evil sorcerer’s harem, and as violent scenes of torture for the pleasure of a cruel warlord. Freeing slaves from the hands of wicked oppressors can make for incredibly fulfilling adventure material, but some players might have a strong reaction to depictions of forced servitude in its many forms. It can help to reframe slaves as “captives” or “prisoners,” which emphasizes the temporary nature of their captivity, and by making their labor as free of violence as possible. Either way, be sure to discuss how slavery is depicted in fantasy with your group.</p><h3>Classism</h3><p>As a Feudal society, Aysle is intensely classconscious. People are generally born into a place in the social hierarchy, and aside from marriage or the occasional patronage, it is impossible to improve one’s lot. One’s place in the social strata determines access to resources, legal and police protection, ability to travel, community inclusion, expectations of respect, and so much more. Some might find the inequitable situation in Aysle tough to take. In a game based on cinematic action and adventure, local systemic imbalances should be easy to gloss over.</p><img class=\"img-mid\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/s0-01.webp\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>An adventure in one cosm can have elements from another. Talk this over with your players</em></p><h3>Legends, Folktales, and Fairy Tales</h3><p>Aysle’s relationship to modern fantasy tropes is clear, but we also brought in a heavy dose of European folk and fairy tales, taking inspiration from the Brothers Grimm, etc. Some of these old stories are extremely harsh, with children being common victims. GMs can still stay true to the spirit of Aysle without leaning on the darker aspects of victimization and cruelty.</p><p>Additionally, some players might be particularly knowledgeable and fond of the local myths from parts of Northern Europe, and might find their translation into fantasy critters a violation of the spirit of those legends. This is especially true of faeries (the Seelie and Unseelie), even unique folk figures like Cuchulain. In this case, consider modifying and renaming them into something that no longer remotely resembles their beloved realworld counterparts.</p><h3>Monsters</h3><p>Just like in other fantasy roleplaying games, Aysle is filled with terrible creatures. Some of them might elicit a surprising negative response in a few players — for example, those with strong spider phobias might have a hard time with nibikrids, which are giant talking spiders. Other players might be bothered by the idea of the undead, necromancy, and the moral violation that comes with raising the dead. Ask if there are certain types of monsters the players would prefer not to encounter.</p><p>I’d also like to point out that fantasy fiction and roleplaying games have for decades conflated the race or species of humanoid creatures (elves, dwarves, goblins, and so on) with their culture, and sometimes declared all members of entire races as irredeemably evil. This idea is seeing a welcome correction across the hobby. In Aysle, even with its forces of Light and Dark, members of different races can be aligned with good or evil, even if the majority of their brethren tend to fall on one side or the other. Even some monsters which are literally born of Darkness, like lurks, might be redeemable in your game. Avoiding such racial pigeonholing can lead to surprising gameplay—like a Lightaligned lurk who assists the party!</p><h3>EVIL!</h3><p>Lastly, Aysle is a realm of actual good and evil and verifiably-real deities. Some might dislike the concept of an imposed moral absolutism, while others might chafe at the idea of polytheism. But in a way this conflict is the heart of Torg, a game about vastly different realities. Be sure to emphasize that something being true in Aysle doesn’t invalidate it being untrue elsewhere, and let this underscore Torg’s greatest strength: the collision, interaction, and blending of worlds where the rules are very diverse!</p><h1>Cyberpapacy</h1><p><em>Eric Simon picks up the thread with some words about everyone’s favorite religious dystopia.</em> This cosm advertises its content right in the name. Most of the things you’ll need to discuss with your players stem from some combination of its religious and cyberpunk aspects. Before you even get down to specifics, make sure your play group is aware of the general themes and motifs of the Cyberpapacy. They can be hard to avoid entirely, so give your players every opportunity to move the adventure somewhere else.</p><h3>Omnipresent Religion</h3><p>It is important to remember that the Church of Malraux is not the Catholic Church, either in or out of game. Malraux is clearly a false pope, but his Church nevertheless resembles Inquisitionera Catholicism in structure and practice. Some players may be put off by those parallels for a variety of reasons. They may be uncomfortable with using even a false version of Christianity as the “bad guy,” or they may dislike roleplaying in a mono-religious society that is enforced through persecution.</p><p>If the group wants to play in the setting anyway, the best way to navigate these issues is with discussions about how people want to see the Church and its agents portrayed in game. Perhaps they want to see members of the actual Catholic Church fighting against Malraux, or in some other way to set up a more positive view of real-world Christianity to counterbalance the Cyberpope. Perhaps they want to explore the ideas of universal religious freedom and focus on helping anyone denounced as a heretic by the Church.</p><p>Both approaches may help people engage with the religious themes of the setting even when religion and faith are sensitive topics for them. If they can choose their own purpose and guide the tone of the adventure, it can be even more meaningful.</p><h3>Angels, Demons, and Witches</h3><p>The Cyberpapacy makes physical much of what we usually think of as supernatural. In particular, some people may be willing to accept the fiction of a false Church but will draw the line at angels and demons. Some may even be fine with one but not the other. Of course, removing either of these from the setting takes away some of the more challenging antagonists that Storm Knights might face. You may have to do some work to focus certain encounters on the human side of the Church.</p><p>Similarly, witches and their magic are real and present in the Cyberpapacy. Because the Cyberpapacy is a more modern setting than the explicitly fantastical cosm of Aysle, some people may be uncomfortable with the idea that this is close to playing with magic in real life. On the other hand, some people for whom witchcraft is important in their real lives may not appreciate the technological side of the way magic is presented in the Cyberpapacy. Whichever way your group prefers, just go with them: if they don’t want to support the practice of magic, just say that it’s actually technology; if they don’t want to corrupt magic with science, just say the cybertech has no real effect and that the magic comes entirely from the caster. (If your group contains people from both ends of this spectrum, settle in for a very long conversation.)</p><h3>Misogyny and Betrayal</h3><p>The Laws of Heretical Magic and Suspicion both lead to potentially challenging interpersonal scenes, not only between the Storm Knights and the NPCs but possibly among the Storm Knights themselves. Luckily, these are the most avoidable issues in the Cyberpapacy.</p><p>Because of the socially backward attitudes of the Church, combined with the issues with witches mentioned above, the <em>Cyberpapacy Sourcebook</em> specifies it may be rare to find women in conventional positions of authority—especially religious authority. This misogyny can bleed into social attitudes across the whole cosm. There is, however, no particular need to focus on or even include this facet if you or any of your players would prefer to ignore it. Malraux’s Church is, as mentioned, an entirely fictional church. You can do whatever you want with it at the table. (Of course, you could decide to play into the “smash the patriarchy” themes of witches versus priests if that sounds fun.)</p><p>Church practices also foster such an air of suspicion and accusation that you may be tempted to use that as a plot device, perhaps having a friendly NPC turn against the Storm Knights at a key moment. Keep in mind that personal suspicion and betrayal can be a highly negative experience for some people. Try to speak early on in general terms about whether such betrayals should or should not be available to the GM. And even if you as the GM know you’re not going to use this narrative tool, discuss it with your players, some of whom might decide to leverage the Law of Suspicion for their own story twists. If needed, there are plenty of ways to put suspicion in the background without it directly affecting the players.</p><h3>Disability, Prosthetics, and Mental Autonomy</h3><p>Cybernetic devices in any science fiction setting that contains them raise questions of how disabilities and disabled people are treated within that society. This is particularly thorny in the Cyberpapacy because of the differentiation between sanctioned and non-sanctioned devices. The fact that the Church decides what is allowed and who can get it can feel quite draconian, and it may be upsetting to people who have had to deal with similar attitudes or experiences in their real lives.</p><p>In addition, the effects of cyberware in the setting raise a variety of issues for people dealing with mental illness and emotional abuse. The Law of Sanction raises the possibility that hacked devices can cause cyberpsychosis—which may be a sensitive topic for people who have personal or adjacent experience with mental illness—while sanctioned devices tether the user to the Church —which may be a sensitive topic for people who have experienced manipulative relationships or stalker behavior.</p><p>Any of these issues are likely to be extremely personal to anyone concerned about them. There is no one solution for including or not including them. This is an area where you are likely to need extended and possibly one-on-one discussions with the players affected. Let them tell you what’s comfortable for them, and then follow it.</p><h1>The Living Land</h1><img class=\"imgright\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/s0-02.webp\" width=\"1021\" height=\"1432\" /><p>It’s Greg again; the Living Land is filled with savagery, places of wonder, a Goddess of Life, and deadly dinosaurs. Below are some of the things I suggest you talk about before running adventures in the cosm. I mean, after the illustration, because have you ever tried saying “No!” to Thrakmoss?</p><h3>Bloody Combat</h3><p>The Law of Savagery encourages all out attacks and visceral descriptions of their results. These attacks can be made by, or upon, Storm Knights as well as NPCs. The game’s mechanical effects are integral to running games in the Living Land. But the attendant descriptions are not. Agree on a description level before the talons start to fly.</p><h3>Bodice Ripping Romance</h3><p>Okay, to be fair its a world law that is responsible for most of a character’s torn clothing rather than another character’s passion, but sudden lustful encounters inflamed by the Law of Life are a trope in the Living Land. The default setting is that NPC/ NPC and Storm Knight/NPC sudden romantic encounters are allowed. The attraction can be acted out at the table, but as soon as lips lock or limbs entangle, the camera fades to black. Storm Knight with Storm Knight encounters is crossing the line. You and your group should discuss where the limits should be for your games.\_</p><h3>Everywhere Are Wonders</h3><p>The Law of Wonders states there are mysterious locales filled with fabled treasure and devices sprinkled throughout the Living Land. These wonders, or rumors of them, are often good reason for the Delphi Council to send heroes plunging into the Deep Mist.</p><p>For Session Zero, discuss how much you want to feature the wonders in your game. At the low end, you may only encounter one or two in your fight against Baruk Kaah and his minions. At the high end, you might end up with a game that resembles Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s <em>The Lost World </em>crossed with <em>John Carter of Mars</em>. The Possibility Wars become a backdrop for the exploration of a landscape littered with the trophies of Lanala.</p><h3>Religion</h3><p>The Living Land is the cosm with the greatest spritual power. The believers in Keta Kalles routinely perform miracles. And there are pages of rules to resolve those. But what about other religions? Especially when your players bring their own religious beliefs to the table. There are plenty of religious traditions where prayer is enough to have divine forces do great things. Over my 30 years of Torg I have had a few players get heated when they tried to apply their real world religion to the Living Land.</p><p><em>Torg Eternity </em>is a game with some verisimilitude to the real world, but its not the real world. The game generally requires a character have Perks before they can access miraculous effects. If you and your group want to negotiate exceptions, go ahead. I had a memorable session where the Storm Knights were leading an exodus of refugees to safety over the course of several days. One player found and read a different psalm to the refugees for each day of the journey; she believed that being spiritually prepared was the most important component for a successful journey. It was powerful and appropriate, so yes, all of us at the table came up with some game effects to suit her psalm readings.</p><p>But find out where people stand on this in Session Zero, or risk having a game derailed by a real life adherent insisting on a throwdown with a fictional Goddess.</p><h3>Slavery</h3><p>The Living Land’s Social Axiom mentions slavery is possible. Slavery is not an Edeinos institution, and they do not engage in the trafficking of humans or Edeinos. So while it is socially possible, the cultures of the Living Land don’t really engage in it. Your Living Land campaign can get by just fine without it.</p><h1>Nile Empire</h1><p>Hey it’s Greg again; just stepped away to jot down a threat idea. The Nile Empire is the cosm of two-fisted action, morality as stark in contrast as cinematography on an old film noir, and pulp powers that would do Doc Savage proud. Here are some Session Zero topics you might want to discuss with your group.</p><h3>Cultural Stereotypes</h3><p>The 1930’s pulp stories were fast and actionpacked, but so many were heaped atop enough negative cultural stereotypes that they could have formed their own mountain range. We had serious back and forth during the development of <em>Torg Eternity</em>, essentially setting our own lines and veils for the game. We wanted to eliminate as much of that baggage from our game as we could. I think you want to do that for your table as well.</p><p>We specifically called out that men and women are more equal in the Nile Empire than they were in the 1930s or the pulps that inspired it. We should have mentioned that holds true for those regions of Core Earth as well. I have had an uncomfortable demo session or two where poor behavior was justified with, “That’s how they treat women over there.” I can kick anyone I need to from a demo table, but your friends are less disposable. Talk with your group about how its possible to capture the flavor of Egypt run by a pulp-powered Pharaoh without denigrating any gender, and where your group’s comfort zone lies.</p><p>The same discussion should be had concerning depictions of religious followers in the Nile Empire. Amaatists are a fictional religion, so they are fair game for whatever nefarious deeds and broadbrush behavior you want in your adventures. But Core Earth Christians, Jews, and Muslims? Just no. Talk this over with your group before hard feelings erupt at the table.</p><p>In pulp stories of the 1930s, the heroes were almost always white males. We have made the Nile Empire more diverse in its ranks of heroes and villains. Core Earth allies are most often African.. So while Nile Empire action is pulpy, its demographics are not. I have run some convention sessions where this point confused a player or two. That confusion rested on ugly stereotypes that spilled over onto the table in ways that made my other players uncomfortable. Talk about and set expectations before you run an arc in the Nile Empire.</p><img class=\"imgleft\" style=\"shape-outside:url('systems/torgeternity/images/s0-03.webp');shape-margin:0.5rem\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/s0-03.webp\" width=\"1524\" height=\"1950\" /><h3>Capture, Interrogation, Torture</h3><p>Villains are gonna villain, and in the pulp reality tough interrogation and potential torture are story staples. That doesn’t mean they have to be staples for your group. The Nile Empire’s default setting is that villainous threats of torture are part of interacting with bad guys, and so they can be played out on the table. That may not be what your group is comfortable with.</p><p>Capture, interrogation, and eventual escape are common in the Nile Empire. If your group isn’t comfortable with this, then what kind of temporary defeat are they willing to have their characters suffer?</p><p>And at what point does the camera fade to black? In the intro fiction, what do your players want to happen at the table if Zhang Zhi gets lowered into that pit of scorpions?</p><h3>Nile Morality</h3><p>Storm Knights and villains live at polar opposites of the morality scales in the Nile Empire. Players are fine with being the heroes. However some players react poorly when being a hero constrains their behavior. In the Nile Empire, such constraints absolutely exist.</p><p>Talk with you group about moral standards and behavior for heroes. The Law of Morality already says villains are not summarily executed when captured. What other behavior is off limits for heroes?</p><p>Heroes are often faced with a choice of following the main mission or helping someone in distress. The default Nile Empire expectation is that heroes help those who cannot help themselves, even if it means the villain gets away or succeeds in a scene. Make sure your players are good with that.</p><p>If during your discussion on Nile Morality you run into significant disagreement on the role and limits on a hero, that may be a sign the Nile Empire should be a brief stop for your players. I mean, there is always Pan-Pacifica.</p><h1>Orrorsh</h1><p>Tracy Sizemore here. Nothing conjures up dark images and apprehensive feelings faster than the concept of playing a horror game. Orrorsh is a cosm full of horror, including all the tropes you’d expect: terrible monsters, dark shadows, creeping corruption, impossible visions, paralyzing fear, and the loss of hope. Make no mistake, it’s a cosm requiring buy-in from your players.</p><h3>Horror</h3><p>Let’s start with the most obvious challenge. Horrible things happen in Orrorsh. That’s the way it is. Horror isn’t for everyone, and it can come in several forms, but in Orrorsh it manifests itself on both a macro level, and a personal level.</p><p>Even in Ulysses’ own adventures, we push the bounds of the PG-13 rating in the interest of revealing the truth of what Orrorsh is in a visceral way. Everything from the appearance of giant spiders carrying severed human heads to the murder of the most innocent child happens there. These things are critical to establishing the evil of the Gaunt Man, and why he must be destroyed, but they also make a discussion of lines and veils critical to setting the boundaries and expectations of your group.</p><h3>Managing Boundaries</h3><p>If your group wants less terror and you’re running the published adventures, read the entire adventure before you run it, and know what you might want to veil off a little more. If you’re running your own adventures, your group should give you a good idea of what you can present and what you should avoid.</p><h3>Be True to the Cosm</h3><p>Ultimately, horrible happenings are the core of the cosm. Consider carefully before you take too much of the fear and terror away. The magic triumvirate of horror, hope, and empathy breaks down without the inhuman events that drive it. Orrorsh isn’t wellsuited to becoming an action horror cosm. That’s more the purview of Tharkold.</p><p>It’s completely legitimate for your group to decide going into Orrorsh is rarely or never worth attempting in the unfolding war. If players are particularly averse to the dangers there, it’s better to skip the cosm altogether than to try and bend it into something it isn’t. It’s okay for them to be terrified of it, even if they never go in there.</p><h3>Fear</h3><p>Because of the Law of Perseverance alone, once you do get into Orrorsh, the possibility of a Storm Knight dying is higher than in any other cosm. Soaking wounds is harder here, so with the right combination of enemies, Cosm card play, and poor luck with the dice, even an accidental death is a very real possibility.</p><p>Here’s the big secret though, Orrorsh and the Gaunt Man aren’t necessarily out to kill people. He needs them alive to harvest their possibility energy. Instead, he wants to perpetuate the fear that they can be killed. That’s the real feeling you’re looking to capture with this world law.</p><p>Ultimately this mechanic is meant to encourage a different kind of adventure. While trying to kill one monster after another is possible, it’s an invitation to disaster in Orrorsh. This is especially true because there’s an entire class of monster that simply can’t be killed unless you thoroughly investigate them first: Nightmares. In this way, Orrorsh is a place that lends itself well to adventures of investigation and discovery. Adventures that encourage punching the bad guy in the face are best left to other cosms like the Nile Empire or Aysle.</p><h3>Character Death</h3><p>Still, confrontation is inevitable, and when it happens it’s dangerous. The possibility of character death is something you need to make clear and should carefully discuss with your group. If your players are all in and ready to assume the risk, that’s great! They <em>should </em>be scared of Orrorsh. That’s the point!</p><h3>Characters Just for Orrorsh\_</h3><p>If there’s trepidation, one strategy is to encourage them to create a separate character, just for adventuring in Orrorsh—someone they don’t have such deep ties to—at least not yet.\_</p><p class=\"noindent\"><strong>Always Give Them an Out<br /></strong>Another possibility is to assure your players you’ll always give them a heads up if they’re treading a path leading to major confrontation, and you’ll always give them an out to run away should they choose to. Again, Orrorsh isn’t about death. It’s about fear; keep that in the forefront of your mind when running adventures there.</p><h3>Corruption</h3><p>If character death wasn’t enough, there’s an even worse fate awaiting Storm Knights in Orrorsh. The Law of Eternal Corruption ensures the temptation to steel themselves against the horrors of the cosm at the expense of losing a little of their humanity is always there. To some players, me included, this path leads to a fate worse than death. Knowing my character is out there, out of my control doing horrible things to innocent people keeps me up at night. This is akin to the mind control problem Greg mentioned earlier, only this time it’s permanent.</p><p class=\"noindent\"><strong>Making Corruption Like Death</strong> <br />You should make your players aware of the mechanics of corruption, and the consequences of falling to darkness. One way to mitigate the problem if the players are worried about it is to promise they won’t run into their old, corrupt characters directly, making corruption very much like death. While this takes a bit of the impact of corruption away, it could give some player groups a little peace of mind.</p><p class=\"noindent\"><strong>Minimizing Corruption</strong> <br />Another way is to minimize your offerings of those hard choices. Talk to your players about how big of a role they want corruption to play in the game, and then adjust both your strategy and their strategy in taking Perks utilizing it, accordingly.</p><h3>Colonialism</h3><p>The Victorians from Gaea represent a grave and complex problem that gripped much of the developing world. Just as the British colonized and exploited India, so too are the Victorians acting in a similar fashion.</p><p class=\"noindent\"><strong>The Victorians</strong><br />First of all, it’s important to keep in mind in the grand scheme of the possibility wars, the Victorians are <em>wrong</em>. Despite what they claim, they don’t have the answers, and their attempts to be the saviors of Core Earth are doomed to failure, just as their world Gaea is doomed to destruction. It’s critical they are not aggrandized as the heroes of the reality invasion.</p><p>Though there are certainly individuals (especially Storm Knights) who are pure of heart with good intentions, as a whole, the Victorians are simply another tool of the Gaunt Man for spreading false hope and lies to an unsuspecting population.</p><p class=\"noindent\"><strong>Minimizing Colonialism</strong> <br />Although it contributes to the complexity of the cosm and dealing with its problems, the colonialism of Orrorsh is one aspect of the world you can safely downplay without losing too much. Talk to your players about it. If there’s sensitivity, or even lack of interest there, don’t be afraid to downplay it. Perhaps in your game the Victorians utterly fail to recolonize India</p><h3>Empathy</h3><p>While on the surface, Orrorsh seems like a horrible place (and it is), it is unlike Tharkold in one key respect: empathy and connection are how you win. The Gaunt man intends to sew fear and mistrust. He and the horrors under his command feed off it. The more the Storm Knights understand about its reality, and the more allies they find to connect with, the more power they have to fight fear and stave off creeping corruption.</p><h3>The Power of Leadership</h3><p>It may not look it, because The Gaunt Man doesn’t want the Storm Knights to see it this way, but Orrorsh is a place filled with millions of good people, trying their best—people who can be inspired to help and conquer their own fears if they have heroes to lead them. It’s a place of discovery, and a place hiding some of the deepest secrets of the Gaunt Man’s plans. It’s a place where the destruction of a single Nightmare is an almost impossible task, but if completed, is a huge and palpable blow to its High Lord’s tight reins of control over its people.</p><p>Run your game with these ideas in mind, and you’ll be able to scare your players, while at\_the same time giving them a unique sense of accomplishment they can’t find in any other cosm.</p><h1>Pan-Pacifica</h1><p>Hi! I am John Watson, and I am a game master. Yes, sometimes it does feel like an addiction with the mix of emotions we can experience when prepping to run a game. Anxiety, anticipation, joy, and even some fear is not all that uncommon when working on a new game. Why? You want to have fun and so do your friends. When you are the game master you have a large amount of the responsibility to ensure that happens for everyone at the table. “If everyone has fun, you win,” is a simple yet accurate way that the designers of the West End <em>Star Wars</em> game described how to win while playing any tabletop roleplaying game. This is really where the pressure comes from for many game masters.</p><p>So how do you relax and run a great game? That is where session zero can really help you out. Rather than taking on all the pressure and responsibility to run the perfect game yourself, everyone can lend a hand. Many hands make for light work, after all. Running a session of <em>Torg Eternity</em> is no exception.</p><p>I like to start with big picture and work my way to more specifics from there. First it is important to establish what style of play everyone has. <em>Torg Eternity</em>, after all, is a very diverse game with numerous settings the Storm Knights can travel in between freely. Knowing what your players really want can influence which cosms they explore and do not explore. Styles of play can be anything from heavy combat where the Storm Knights loot and dungeon crawl (dungeon delving in Aysle or exploring the Blasted Lands of Tharkold could fit this style), heavy roleplaying where everyone is constantly in character with a lush and dramatic story take precedent (intrigue in Pan-Pacifica or drama in the Nile Empire could fit this style), a combination of the two styles or anything in between.</p><p>After you have established the overall play style as a group, get more detailed as to what everyone wants from the game exactly. This exercise can be as broad or specific as you want. Ask the players things like, “What do you want from this game?,” and, “What kinds of things would excite you about coming to the table every session?” The players should also be encouraged to ask the game master and other players questions. This will really help give everyone a sense of what sort of game it is and ideas for both players and the game master.</p><p>It is also important to discuss what is off limits. As a game master I have always led this during session zero to tell my players what subjects their Storm Knights will not experience during game play. After I have said my part, I turn it over to my players and ask them if there are any taboo topics for the game. I also stress if they do not like talking about the topic they can email, text, write me a letter, or let me know in whatever way they can while remaining comfortable.</p><p>This process can be as long or as short as you want it. An entire session dedicated to this is the most helpful for me. If everyone is really open and involved in the discussion this will make your session zero very productive and take a great deal of the stress off of everyone’s shoulders.</p><h3>Pan-Pacifica</h3><p>Pan-Pacifica has a lot of themes that can bring unique challenges to the gaming table. Many of the Cosm cards can force a game master to make some significant plot changes. Players might expect this to happen immediately, but by establishing up front that this may not always be the case will eliminate false expectations. There are also some more mature themes like the crime syndicates and the jiangshi contagion. They can be some great devices for story but might give concern to some players. A few bits of wisdom about how to handle some of the more difficult themes to navigate in Pan-Pacifica follow. Take what you like and leave what you like.\_</p><h3>Betrayal</h3><p>Some of the most memorable <em>Torg Eternity</em> games I have run in Pan-Pacifica dealt with betrayal. One specific game started with one of the Storm Knights falling in love with a prominent NPC. Later, that NPC betrayed the Storm Knight though the NPC professed her love, claiming she had no choice in the matter. The adventure ended with the Storm Knight saving the lives of many but dying in the process. The NPC, overwhelmed with the grief of her betrayal and the Storm Knight’s sacrifice, then experienced her moment of crisis that transformed the NPC into a Storm Knight. The new Storm Knight took up her fallen lover’s mantel and joined the rest of the Storm Knights to redeem herself and honor the life of her lost love.</p><p>The above scenario happened by no plans of mine. The Storm Knight played the <em>Romance </em>Destiny card on the NPC and not long after played the <em>Sold Out</em> Cosm card. The connection was an obvious one and made for an incredibly epic build up and a better ending than I could have planned if I wrote it. This could have been a major challenge to put it all together quickly, but before the game started, I informed my players that Destiny and Cosm cards may not have an immediate impact. I would wait until the moment was appropriate. This gave me time to think things through as I was running the game, and the players already had that expectation in mind. That made it a lot easier on me as a game master and allowed me the time to put it together the right way to where it was an excellent story tool.\_</p><p>While managing the sudden betrayal that can happen through cosm cards in Pan-Pacifica is the greatest hurdle to overcome for the betrayal theme, it is also important to discuss this topic with your players ahead of time. If the player who played the Cosm card had just experienced a rough ending to a relationship, taking a different direction with the <em>Sold Out</em> Cosm card would have been more appropriate.\_</p><h3>Corporate Control</h3><p>The Kanawa Corporation has a firm grip on PanPacifica. Practically everything is owned by them. Storm Knights commonly must sneak in and out of the cosm, or the Delphi Council is forced to rely on those already within. This military-like state can make many mundane tasks more challenging.\_\_</p><p>This theme is what can allow many characters to shine. Strom Knights with skills like <em>streetwise </em>and <em>persuasion </em>become even more valuable in Pan-Pacifica. While the threat of Kanawa Security is always looming around the corner, Storm Knights skilled at fast talking can convince troopers that they are of no interest. Another Storm Knight could find an old abandoned building that the locals use to get the goods and services that Kanawa Corp regulates to an extreme. The possibilities of leveraging this theme to allow the more behind the scenes Storm Knights to step into the spotlight are limitless.</p><h3>The Crime Syndicates</h3><p>The various crime syndicates throughout PanPacifica are not made up of nice people. Most of us have heard scary stories and rumors about the things they have done to people who have crossed them or to make an example out of someone.</p><p>Remind your players, that isn’t real life. <em>Torg Eternity</em> is not only an alternate timeline, but a different world than ours. There are similarities, but they are not identical. Kanawa Corp is the bigger threat in Pan-Pacifica. While not friendly types, all the criminal organizations in Pan-Pacifica wage open war against Kanawa. The Storm Knights likely might find the gang members as unlikely allies as they work towards a common goal.</p><p>Still, it is important to openly discuss this topic to avoid any misunderstandings. Explain how the various crime syndicates are thought of by the Delphi Council representatives in Pan-Pacifica in your game. Everyone can get a good understanding of how they will be represented in the game and if any elements commonly associated with the syndicates are off limits.</p><h3>The Virus</h3><p>As I write this, our world is currently facing a pandemic. It is likely to have impacted every person who is reading this in some capacity. Themes that can be associated with real life experiences (especially current ones) are the ones we should handle most delicately. Though the jiangshi contagion is a psychic virus that transforms its victims into zombies, it could still be a little too fresh for some.\_</p><p>Openly discuss this theme with players. We have all experienced it in some capacity, so it is best to be candid about it. Some of the Pan-Pacifica Cosm cards directly deal with the jiangshi virus. Unless the cards are removed from the Cosm Deck, this theme will surface at some point. The simplest way to handle this is to say that in your <em>Torg Eternity</em> game that a cure or vaccine was discovered. The infected will still exist, but the chances of getting the virus and/or dying from it are significantly smaller.</p><p>If all your players are okay with it, the jiangshi contagion can add some interesting elements to your game. Trying to avoid infection, seeking out experts who can find a cure, going on missions to secure a possible cure, finding a way to bring an important NPC back from infection—there are numerous possibilities for games run around this theme. Just take care with it based on recent events.</p><h1>Tharkold</h1><p>Hi, I’m Leamon Crafton Jr., one of the writers on the <em>Torg Eternity</em> team. I’ve spent time in both Russia and Ukraine. Russia itself can be a scary place. The most afraid I’ve ever been in my life was in a Russian police “station.” I put the station in quotes because it was a little room under an airport through security doors and corridors that lead through maintenance tunnels with pipes and wiring overhead. Pretty much exactly as you might have seen in a movie when a poor schmuck gets hauled away and interrogated while strapped to a chair, where his screams can’t be heard. It might be a slight exaggeration, but that’s exactly how I was feeling when it happened to me. I had misplaced a small registration card and, while I can smile and laugh at the situation now, at that moment I was very afraid. That experience was without the Tharkold reality.</p><p>Of all the cosms, Tharkold has the potential of being the most disturbing. While <em>Torg Eternity</em> is heroic, even if desperate, each cosm is a separate reality. Tharkold is an extreme example of this. Storm Knights can be heroes, but the cosm is far from being a heroic one. Tharkold is a reality that puts uneasy topics out in the open. Players as well as Game Masters might hesitate or be confused at how such a realm differs so greatly from others in its presentation. It is the realm where you may need to draw more lines. Topics such as body horror, thralldom, and splatter punk are themes in Tharkold.</p><p>As Greg mentioned before, talk with your group and use the tools given here to make the game comfortable for everyone. If you are hesitant in getting into Tharkold, that’s fine. Agents and threats from one realm can go to others. You can always take Tharkoldu or Tharkold threats and bring them into another realm to confront the Storm Knights. Nothing or no one needs to force an adventure to happen in Tharkold. But if you go there, some of the themes you want to be aware of and talk with your group about are listed below.</p><img class=\"img-mid\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/s0-04.webp\" width=\"1918\" height=\"1110\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Adventuring in Kur is definitely on the discussion checklist</em></p><h3>Intimidation</h3><p><em>Intimidation </em>goes farther than normal in Tharkold. The Law of Domination, Cosm cards, and the Tharkold specific Drama Deck all bring <em>intimidation </em>to the forefront. Tharkold threats try to use <em>intimidation </em>on Storm Knights, possibly leading to instances where the Storm Knight react in a way that makes the player uncomfortable. Or a Storm Knight might use <em>intimidation </em>to force a NPC into doing things against that NPC’s will. Be aware of how a simple skill in most realms has the potential to lead down a dark path while in Tharkold.</p><h3>Mutations</h3><p>Mutations in the Blasted Land play a pretty big part in that area. These bring both Pros and Cons to characters, mechanically, but even the beneficial ones are expressed visually in deformations of the body. Talk with your group about this aspect. It might come too close to body shaming for some. Put up your veil or draw lines as needed.</p><h3>Politics</h3><p>While it is an old saying to not discuss politics, Tharkold has the distinct premise in Torg Eternity that Core Earth Russia willingly allied with demon invaders. Then it invaded areas of Eastern Europe that historically had been under Soviet rule. If you have players that come from those areas, they might not want to delve into this theme. It comes close to what happened and is happening currently in the real world. I have friends who went through the Orange and Maidan Revolutions in Kyiv. This topic is recent and heavy on their minds. Don’t choose historic accuracy over the well-being of you or your players. Don’t be afraid to say, “We are going to stick to Russia and not go to the other areas.” The locations in published adventures are easily changed.</p><h3>Body Horror</h3><p>In Tharkold, flesh can be sculpted like clay into gruesome forms and occultech replaces body parts with machinery powered by pain. Horrible experiments and spells in Tharkold change the victims’ bodies and minds. Creatures with twisted forms account for a lot of the threats in Tharkold. The Law of Ferocity is much like the Living Land’s Law of Savagery when Drama cards are flipped and combat starts. And like in that cosm, there might be a temptation to play things up with descriptions of splatter punk. Use the suggestions in <strong>Bloody Combat</strong> in the Living Land entry to help. Limit or remove physical descriptions as needed.</p><h3>Inflicted Suffering</h3><p>In Tharkold, people and creatures inflict visual and physical pain on others. The substance of pain can be condensed into a crystal-like structure called Vril by hooking people up to torture devices. The Law of Pain encourages Storm Knights to wound their enemies as they benefit from it by healing Shock damage, so they might be tempted to kill opponents rather than knocking them out, like say, the Nile Empire where Possibilities can be gained by letting a defeated foe return. All these things might cause unease and discomfort. Remember, Storm Knights are still heroes in Tharkold.</p><h3>Thralls</h3><p>Tharkold has thralls and thralldom. This is slaves and slavery by another name. Tharkold thralldom is less human trafficking and more taking and forcing people to be servants or having been born a thrall and staying a thrall. But this does not make it any better. Freedom is lost. The Delphi Council does not have thralls, but the Law of Domination tends to set people up in a pecking order. It might be difficult to ignore this aspect as it is tied into the history and world laws of Tharkold, but that does not mean it can’t be placed behind a veil, or even removed if it poses a problem. Also watch how your group approaches this theme, especially if someone tries to set up a dominance chain amongst the Storm Knights themselves.</p>"

      content: "<h1>Storm Knights</h1><p>Storm Knights are heroes with the ability to manipulate possibility energy. In Torg Eternity, each player character is a Storm Knight.</p><p>A character becomes a Storm Knight when they experience a Moment of Crisis.\_\_Once they become a Storm Knight, a character may draw on a special reserve of called Possibility Energy.</p><p>The Torg Eternity Foundry module includes a compendium that contains a set of 16 character archetypes that are ready to play. The rules and other data necessary to create your own characters are included in the Torg Eternity Core Rules Module, which is available for purchase.</p><div class=\"sidenote\"><h4>Armor Piercing</h4><p>The Electric Warrior’s Electric Katana and the Monster Hunter’s Adamant Shells each piece armor. Armor Piercing negates Armor adds to Toughness. Gospog and Edeinos Warriors don’t have armor, so there’s no effect. The Tyrannosaur’s Toughness has 3 Armor, so the katana would knock it down to Toughness 18, and the Adamant Shells to Toughness 17.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: When using an enhanced attack , Armor Piercing (AP) effects will be automatically calculated (see @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#managing-cards]{Managing Cards}).</p></blockquote><h4>Sabretooth Cat</h4><p>The Primitive Warrior has a “pet” who acts on her turn. The player controls the cat as well, and tracks its Shock and Wounds separately. The cat doesn’t have Possibilities of its own, but the player may spend the Primitive Warrior’s Possibilites to the creature’s tests or soak damage done to it.</p><p>If you aren't sure what to do, the cat can make a @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combined-attack]{Combined Attack} against the same target, which gives the Primitive Warrior a +1 to the test. If Maneuver is an Approved Action suggest the cat set up a foe for the Primitive Warrior to finish off. This shows Interaction Attacks and she even gets the Destiny Card on a success. For anything else, the Sabretooth Cat’s statistics are included in the same manner as the other threats.</p><h4>Short Burst</h4><p>The Electric Samurai’s gun fires Short Bursts. Each attack against a target expends 3 bullets, but grants a +2 bonus to hit. A roll of 1 Disconnects as usual, but a roll of 2 causes the weapon to malfunction. It may not be fired again until the character uses an Action (no test necessary) to fix the problem.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong style=\"font-style:italic\">Foundry System Note:</strong> If you make an attack with a short burst, the system will automatically calculate a bonus (see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#attack]{Attack}).</em></p></blockquote></div><h2>Moment of Crisis</h2><p>A character becomes a Storm Knight when they respond in a heroic way to a Moment of Crisis. For example, they might risk their lives to rescue other people, or confront a creature that is twice their size in order to save someone's life. When this happens, raw energy floods into the hero, and they gain the ability to bend reality to their own will.</p><h2>Possibility Energy</h2><p>Possiblity Energy represents the ability of Storm Knights to \"push back\" against a reality.\_</p><p>Most players begin a session with three (3) possiblities. Characters who have the Prodigy perk begin with four.</p><h2>Destiny Cards</h2><p>At the start of a session, each player should draw four (4) Destiny cards. Each card explains its effect. Outside of combat, these cards may be traded between players (one for one) at any time.</p><p>For more information on using cards in the Foundry system, see @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#managing-cards]{Managing Cards}.</p><h1>Reality</h1><p>When Storm Knights visit different realms affected by other realities, these axioms and laws change to reflect what’s easy to do here, and what’s hard. Axioms measure what’s plentiful in a reality, and what’s “impossible.” As an Example here are the Axioms and World Laws from the Living Land.</p><img src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/cosm-cards/livingLand.webp\" /><h2>Axioms</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Magic Axiom:</strong> The low number means magic doesn’t exist here. The only character with any magic is the Realm Runner, who has a magic potion. Carrying it creates a “Contradiction”, which means he’s out of step with reality at risk of @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#disconnection]{Disconnection}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Axiom:</strong> The low number means higher level civilization isn’t supported here. Democracy doesn’t make sense to people attuned to the realm…but following the strongest hunter and taking what you want does! If any Storm Knight had Psionic powers, they would be contradictory here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spirit Axiom:</strong> The high number means faith has tangible effects in the Living Land. Gods are real, and praying for miracles works without contradiction!</p></li><li><p><strong>Tech Axiom:</strong> This is the number most of the Storm Knights present care about. Advanced technology is contradictory here. Each character has an Axiom listed for their items. If the number is above 6 the item is a Contradiction within the Living Land, so using it opens the character to the possibility of Disconnection.</p></li></ul><h2>World Laws</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Law of Savagery:</strong> When battle rages, things get bloody in the Living Land. Don’t dwell on the exact meaning of this rule until combat starts.\_</p></li><li><p><strong>Law of Life:</strong> Wounds heal quickly here, and dead matter decomposes rapidly as well. It’s unlikely for this rule to come up during the game, but if it does, see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#defeat]{Defeat}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Law of Wonders:</strong> Lost things turn up unexpectedly in the Living Land, and stone and metal buildings that would normally crumble into rubble tend to remain standing as vine covered monoliths instead.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:\_</strong>To see the Axioms and World Laws that are applicable to the current scene, locate the icon at the top of the screen that shows the name of the current screen and hover over the cosm icon on that scene. This reveals the \"table tent\" information for the scene.</p></blockquote><h2>Cosm Cards</h2><p>A Cosm Card represents a particular feature of the reality where the players are currently adventuring. Each player is issued a single Cosm Card at the start of each session. Unless the text of the card indicates otherwise, a player may choose to play a Cosm card at any time.</p><p>For more information on using cards in the Foundry system, see @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#managing-cards]{Managing Cards}.</p><p></p><h1>Skill and Attribute Tests</h1><p>The attribute test and the skill test are the core mechanics in Torg Eternity.</p><p>Each character sheet includes a list of five attributes and a list of skills. To make an attribute or skill test in Foundry, click on the name of the attribute or skill. If you are attacking with a weapon, or using a power, click on the d20 icon that appears beside the weapon and/or power name. The result of your skill or attribute test will be displayed in the chat.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: You can also make an enhanced skill test. To make an enhanced test, shift-click on the appropriate skill. This will present you with a window that allows you to input your desired DN, as well as any applicable modifiers. The window will also show any modifiers based on status effects that will be automatically applied.

During that time, each character can move and perform one or more actions.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:\_</strong>The information that is relevant to combat and dramatic skill resolutions in Torg is contained in the Combat Tracker. To access the Combat Tracker, click on the fist-shaped tab/icon on the top right of the screen. In order to ensure that both the Combat Tracker and chat are displayed at all times, you may want to pop out the combat tracker by\_ right-clicking on it.</p><p>The GM must initiate a combat before the Combat Tracker will display any data. To initiate a combat, first select the tokens for all of the charactters that will participate in the combat. Then, right click on one of the tokens and click on the Toggle Combat State button. After all characters are selected, click on Begin Combat in the Combat Tracker.</p></blockquote><h3>Initiative: How to Use the Drama Cards\_</h3><p>In order to determine the order in which the players and threats will act, the GM draws a @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#drama-cards]{Drama Card}. The current Drama card is always displayed at the top of the Combat Tracker.</p><p>The Drama card includes two conflict lines. One applies to combat rounds that take place in Standard Scenes and the other applies to combat rounds that take place in Dramatic scenes (see the @UUID[.vKRDjVnjWqsowkYt#acts,-scenes,-and-rounds:-how-torg-eternity-games-are-structured]{Acts, Scenes, and Rounds: How Torg Eternity Games are Structured} for more on Standard and Dramatic scenes). The conflict line indicates whether the Heroes (H) or the Villains (V) go first. The conflict line may also include conditions that affect one or both sides. See @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#drama-cards]{Drama Card} for a description of what each condition means.</p><p>When the heroes take their turn, each character may act in any order desired. Likewise, all threats may act in any order that the GM determines.</p><p><strong>Surprise. </strong>If the GM determines that one side is surprised, that side is not allowed to act during the combat round if the combat line shows that they should go first. !\_</p><p>Once everyone has finished taking a turn, the round is complete. Flip over a new Drama Card for the next round.</p><h3>The Action Pool</h3><p>Until an encounter begins there’s no limit on trading or playing Destiny Cards. However, once battle is joined things get trickier! Cards may only be played or traded from each character’s Action Pool, and that pool starts off empty. At the end of each turn after the character acts, the player may put one Destiny Card in their pool by clicking on the check box in their hand (see @UUID[.JVIgUlHyiBLmAwf4#managing-cards]{Managing Cards}). The card may then be played immediately, or at any time after that. Putting a card in the Action Pool isn’t playing it. Instead, it makes the card available for play.</p><p>The cards in each player's pool are listed in the Combat Tracker. To see the contents of any listed card, hover over its thumbnail.</p><h2>The Character Turn</h2><p>When a hero (or threat) takes their turn, they can move up to their walking or running speed (see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#moving]{Moving} for more details). Any character that moves at its running speed incurs a -2 penalty for all actions during the round.</p><p>When taking an action, characters have several basic options.</p><ul><li>An @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#attack]{Attack} attempts to physically damage a target.</li><li>An @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#defend]{Defend} is a concentrated effort to avoid damage.</li><li>An @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#interaction-attack]{Interaction Attack} attempts to place the opponent at a disadvantage using cunning words and/or actions.</li></ul><p>When a character is hit, follow the rules for @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#damage]{Damage}.</p><p>Other rules that may come into play during the combat encounters include the following:</p><ul><li>@UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#multi-actions]{Multi-Actions} apply when a character attempts more than one action at once.</li><li>A Storm Knight or threat may also attack @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#multi-targets]{Multi-Targets}.</li><li>A Storm Knight may have a weapon that does @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#armor-piercing]{Armor Piercing} damage.</li><li>A Storm Knight may have a firearm that utilizes the @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#short-burst]{Short Burst}.</li><li>A @UUID[Compendium.torgeternity.archetypes.Actor.sPLt8RBL1hieic6p]{Primitive Hunter} may want to utilize her @UUID[Compendium.torgeternity.archetypes.Actor.0ScjEZmA3HcIcn4g]{Companion: Sabre-Tooth Cat}. Likewise, an @UUID[Compendium.torgeternity.archetypes.Actor.cdSvyJHbG0GbFzkh]{Elven Warden} may want to use her @UUID[Compendium.torgeternity.archetypes.Actor.azyXdSKJRLmriHz6]{White Wolf}, following the same rules.</li><li>If a Storm Knight is using equipment that has a tech level that is higher than the tech axiom of the the current cosm/location, and if that Storm Knight rolls a 1 on any test involving such equipment, that character must test for @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#disconnection]{Disconnection}.</li><li>Likewise, if a Storm Knight is using magic that has a magic level that is higher than the magic axiom of the current cosm/location, and if that Storm Knight rolls a 1on on any test involving such magic, that character must test for @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#disconnection]{Disconnection}.</li><li>If a Storm Knight suffers more than three wounds, the Storm Knight must test for @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#defeat]{Defeat}.</li><li>When a threat incurs wounds that exceed its wound threshold, it does not test for Defeat. Instead, it is immediately defeated.</li><li>When attacking with threats, the GM may want to consider utilizing a @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combined-attack]{Combined Attack}.</li><li>If a Storm Knight attempts to fire a gun or other ranged attack into melee combat, they take a risk of injuring an ally by @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#friendly-fire]{Friendly Fire}.</li></ul><h2>Drama Cards</h2><p>The conflict line on a Drama Card may contain a special condition that applies to one of the sides in the conflict. Here’s what each condition means:</p><ul><li><strong>Setback</strong>: If the heroes suffer a Setback, something happens to make the situation more complicated for the affected side.</li><li><strong>Confused</strong>: The Heroes may not activate Destiny Cards. They may still earn them and play them into their Action Pools.</li><li><strong>Up</strong>: The side with an Up rolls a die for tests, and then immediately adds another die regardless of the result!</li><li><strong>Fatigue</strong>: Each hero immediately suffers 2 Shock (see Shock below). If the hero is wearing Armor with the Fatigues property she suffers 3 Shock instead, or more if the Armor lists a larger number! Some threats are immune to Shock, so a Fatigued result doesn’t hamper them at all!</li><li><strong>Inspiration</strong>: Each character on the affected side recovers 2 Shock. See @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#damage]{Damage}.</li><li><strong>Surge</strong>: The reality of the Living Land pushes against Storm Knights who have contradictory items. Each player rolls a d20. On a 1, a character with a contradiction @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#disconnects]{Disconnects}. The Realm Runner is carrying items that don’t just exceed the Living Land’s axioms, they exceed his own! He Disconnects on a roll of 1-4 so long as he’s carrying them.</li><li><strong>Flurry</strong>: Resolve all actions for that side normally. Then every character on that side acts again!</li></ul><h3>Approved Actions</h3><p>At the bottom of the card one or two of the following are listed: Attack, Defend, Intimidate, Maneuver, Taunt, and Trick, plus “Any” and “Any Multi-Action”. If a character attempts the listed action and succeeds the player draws a new Destiny Card.\_</p><div class=\"sidenote right\"><h4>The Law of Savagery and All-Out Attacks</h4><p>If Attack is an Approved Action, describe the All-Out Attack special option to players. This option is only available to hand to hand attacks, so melee weapons or unarmed combat. The attacker gains a +4 bonus to hit, but becomes Very Vulnerable (+4) in return. The option is always available, but the Law of Savagery makes it especially tempting when Attack is Approved: a hit with an All-Out Attack gains an extra Bonus Die (+1 BD) of damage…in addition to any other dice granted by a Good or Outstanding success. Note that Villains also take advantage of this option when Attack is Approved!</p></div><h3>Steps and Dilemmas</h3><p>Along the side are letters (A, B, C, and D) or a Dilemma (Complication, Critical Problem, and Potential Setback). These elements are used in @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#dramatic-skill-resolution]{Dramatic Skill Resolution}.</p><h2>Basic Actions</h2><p>When the heroes (or a Threat) act they have several basic options. Attack is the most common and likely, but introduce the concept of Interaction Attacks when an appropriate one is the Approved Action - Maneuver or Trick, since Gospog are immune to Intimidation and Taunt.</p><h6>Moving</h6><p>Moving isn’t an action, but happens on each character’s turn along with the action. Each character has a Move listed in meters. A character may “Run” three times the base number of meters, but suffers a –2 penalty on any test for an action.</p><h6>Attack</h6><p>An attack is a @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#skill-and-attribute-tests]{Skill test} like any other. Fire combat is used for guns, melee weapons for any hand to hand weapons, missile weapons for thrown weapons or bows, and unarmed combat for bare handed attacks. The DN for an attack isn’t 10, but rather is based on the target’s most appropriate Defense. For a ranged attack (fire combat, missile weapons) the DN is equal to the target’s dodge skill. For a hand to hand attack (melee weapons, unarmed combat), the appropriate defense is based on melee weapons if the defender is armed, or unarmed combat if the defender is empty handed. A success deals @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#damage]{Damage}. A Good success adds one Bonus Die (+1 BD) to damage, as described in that section. An Outstanding success adds two Bonus Dice (+2 BD).\_</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> There are two ways to make an attack in the Foundry system. The first is to simply <strong>click on the die icon</strong> beside the listed weapon or attack. The chat will then display the action total for your attack, as well as the base damage of the weapon.</p><p>The second way of attacking is to make an <strong>enhanced attack</strong>. This is the recommended way to make most attacks. To make an enhanced attack, you must first select a target by clicking on the target icon in the toolbar and then clicking on the desired target for your attack. Then, shift-click on the die icon beside your chosen weapon or attack. This will reveal a dialog box. In the dialog box, pick any modifiers that are applicable, then click on the Roll button. This will give you the result of your attack and calculate your base damage.</p><p>For information on rolling bonus dice, see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#damage]{Damage}.</p></blockquote><h6>Defend</h6><p>A hero may use their turn to defend themselves instead of attacking, even if the Villains go first. Click on the Defenses heading on the character sheet to roll against the Bonus Chart and generate a bonus, with a minimum result of +1 (even if the die roll is a 1). That bonus is added to any Defense against attacks or interaction attacks for the rest of the round. If Defend is an Approved Action, the player gains a Destiny card the first time a foe attempts an attack and misses.</p><p>To defend in the Foundry system, click on the \"Defenses\" heading on the character sheet, and your defense roll will be automatically completed and calculated for you.</p><h6>Interaction Attack</h6><p>Interaction attacks may be based on any of the following for skills: <em>intimidation </em>(threatening foes), <em>maneuver </em>(feinting and weaving), <em>taunt </em>(verbal goading), and <em>trick </em>(clever uses of the environment). Interactions function the same way. Pick a target and make a test. The DN for the test is equal to the target’s total in the same skill, so trick vs trick, maneuver vs maneuver, etc.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: To make an interaction attack, first select your target by clicking on the Target icon in the upper left portion of your screen, then click on the desired target. After doing this, click or shift-click on the desired interaction attack in the bottom right portion of your character sheet. (This is the recommended way of conducting an interaction attack. We do not normally recommend clicking on a skill in this situation). The result of your interaction attack will be displayed in chat.</p></blockquote><p>If the attacker succeeds the target is either Stymied (–2 on tests) or Vulnerable (all attacks and interactions are +2 against that target) until the end of their next turn. On a Good success the target is Very Stymied (–4) or Very Vulnerable (+4), or both Stymied (–2) and Vulnerable (+2)…attackers choice!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> If a character or threat is assigned a Stymied or Vulnerable condition, you should right-click on its token and assign the appropriate effect on the token. This will cause the system to automatically calculate the effect on future skill and attack tests.</p></blockquote><p>An Outstanding result is called a Player’s Call. The Good effect still applies, plus the player and GM negotiate an additional effect. This might be as potent as a weaker foe fleeing the battle or being taken out by the environment. A stronger foe might not be completely removed by a Player’s Call, but should suffer either a permanent effect or at least losing an action.\_</p><h3>Multi-Actions</h3><p>A Storm Knight may try to do two (or more) different actions on the same turn, for example tricking one foe and then attacking another. Multiactions are simultaneous, so the results of an interaction attack don’t apply in time to help an attack made at the same time. A –2 penalty applies to every action for each extra attempted. Only <em>one </em>roll is attempted, and the bonus generated applies to each action separately. Don’t bother introducing this concept until a player asks to do something that is best expressed as a Multi-Action or the Approved Action is Multi-Action.\_</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> If you make an enhanced skill test, the system will automatically calculate a multi-action penalty.\_ (see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#skill-and-attribute-tests]{Skill and Attribute Tests} and @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#attack]{Attack}).</p></blockquote><h3>Multi-Targets</h3><p>Similar to Multi-Actions, an attack or interaction attack may target multiple foes. If the weapon used requires ammunition, it needs at least one shot for each target. Every extra target for the attack is a –2 penalty, so attempting to trick three Gospog at once is a –4 penalty. Roll <em><strong>once</strong></em>, apply the bonus, then compare the result to each target’s Defense separately and resolve the effects individually. This a good concept to introduce during the second round of combat, once players have gotten comfortable with regular attacks and tests.\_</p><blockquote><p><em><strong style=\"font-style:italic\">Foundry System Note:</strong></em><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><em> If you make an enhanced skill test, the system will automatically calculate a multi-target penalty.\_ (see </em></span>@UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#attack]{Attack}<span style=\"font-style:italic\"><em>).</em></span></p></blockquote><h3>Damage</h3><p>When hit by an attack, the damage of the weapon is compared to the Toughness of the target. Armor is already included in Toughness, so players don’t need to consider it separately. If damage is 5 or more less than Toughness the attack has no effect at all. If damage is less than Toughness it deals 1 Shock. A character who suffers more Shock than the listed limit is Knocked Out (KOed) and no longer takes turns. If damage is at least equal to Toughness the target suffers 2 Shock. If damage is 5 greater than Toughness the target suffers 2 Shock and 1 Wound (see below). Every +5 damage beyond that does another Wound and another 2 Shock.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> When making an enhanced attack, Wounds and Shock are automatically calculated for you. For more information on enhanced attacks, see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#attack]{Attack}.</p></blockquote><h3>Wounds</h3><p>Each Wound is a permanent –1 penalty on all tests. When a Storm Knight suffers more than 3 Wounds they are KOed and must test @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#defeat]{Defeat}. Villains like Gospog or regular edeinos are KOed by a single Wound.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> You can record wounds to your character on your character sheet or by right-clicking on your character's token and altering the appropriate number. Once recorded, your wound penalty is taken into account in all future rolls.</p></blockquote><h3>Bonus Dice</h3><p>A Good success or better on an attack, the Law of Savagery, or a character’s individual abilities may earn Bonus Dice (BD) for damage. Start with the attack’s normal damage, then click the BD button at the bottom of the chat message that displays the successful attack. This will roll a single BD and add the result to total damage value. Compare this damage value to Toughness. Rolling a ∞ symbol adds +5 to damage AND rolls another BD!</p><p>If your attack generated more than one BD, continue to click the BD button at the bottom of each new chat message until the correct number of BD have been rolled.</p><h3>Damage Results Table</h3><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Damage</p><p>Over Toughness</p></th><th><p>Damage</p></th></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>-6 or more</p></td><td><p>No effect</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>-5 to -1</p></td><td><p>1 Shock</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>0-4</p></td><td><p>2 Shock</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>5-9</p></td><td><p>1 Wound, 2 Shock</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>10-14</p></td><td><p>2 Wounds, 4 Shock</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>15-19</p></td><td><p>3 Wounds, 6 Shock</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;width:45.3963%;height:16px\"><p>20-24</p></td><td><p>4 Wounds, 8 Shock</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>...and so on</p><h3>Soaking Damage</h3><p>When a Storm Knight first takes a Wound, introduce the concept of Soaking damage, the other major use of Possibilities. The character shifts reality, choosing a version of events where the result of the attack is more favorable. Spend 1 Possibility and make a normal DN 10 test against the character’s reality skill. On a success the damage from the attack is reduced by 1 Wound, and ALL Shock is ignored. A Good success reduces the damage by 2 Wounds. An Outstanding eliminates all damage, regardless of how many Wounds it would have caused.\_</p><h3>Disconnection</h3><p>An attack with a gun or any other item above Tech 7 is a Contradiction in the Living Land. A Storm Knight can still do it, but there’s a risk. If the first die for the test rolls a 1, the hero Disconnects from reality completely. Disconnected characters flicker between different possible versions of themselves. A Disconnected character may still act and use Destiny Cards, but they may not spend Possibility tokens—so no adding dice to rolls or soaking damage! Any Contradictory items become unusable as they phase in and out of existence. That means high–tech weapon attacks become impossible for a Disconnected character, and modern armor temporarily disappears and provides no protection. At the beginning of a Disconnected character’s turn the player rolls a reality skill test against DN 14. If the test succeeds the Storm Knight immediately reconnects, equipment returns to normal, and Possibility energy may be used once more. If the test fails the character remains Disconnected. If the roll is a 1 the character permanently loses 1 skill add in reality but reconnects.\_</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note:</strong> When your character disconnects, you should add a Disconnected status effect to the character. To add a status effect, right click on your character token and click on the Assign Status Effects button.</p></blockquote><h3>Defeat</h3><p>If an unlucky Storm Knight suffers more than 3 Wounds, he rolls a test of either Strength or Spirit—whichever is lower. The DN is 10, but the –3 penalty from those Wounds applies. The Law of Life applies as well, which means another d20 is rolled and added to the first! If the test fails the character is dead. Ouch! On a success the character is KOed and permanently loses 1 from any Attribute (player’s choice). He’ll awaken, still with 3 wounds, in time for Scene Two. A Good result is similar to the success, but the Attribute loss is temporary and recovered when all the Wounds heal. An Outstanding result means the character is still KOed as above, but suffers no Attribute loss.</p><h3>Combined Attack</h3><p>When there are more threats than heroes, it’s likely several attack the same hero each round. When this occurs, only roll once for the group, but they gain a +1 bonus if two are attacking, +2 if three are attacking, and +3 if four to six all swarm the same opponent.</p><h3>Friendly Fire</h3><p>Firing a gun or other ranged attack into melee combat is tricky. If the total on the dice for the attack is even, the attack is against the Defense of the intended target and proceeds normally. If the total for the roll is odd, the attack is against the Defense of another random participant! A character may move out of melee combat at the expense of becoming Vulnerable (+2), so try to time hero actions so friends pull away from the gospog before someone opens fire on them!\_</p><h1>Dramatic Skill Resolution</h1><p>In Torg Eternity, a particulaly tense situation can be played out as a Dramatic Skill Resolution. The team has five rounds (i.e., five Drama Cards) to complete the mission, which consists of four different steps. After five rounds, the dramatic skill resolution results in a failure. However if the team completes all four steps in five rounds or fewer they succeed. The steps for the task are desiganted as Step A through Step D. The GM will determine the nature and difficulty at each step of the skill test.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Foundry System Note</strong>: The Combat Tracker includes a tool that allows you to track the current step in a dramatic skill resolution. By default, the tool shows \"No DSR\". By clicking on the tool, you can advance the DSR to Step A, and then - subsequently - to steps B through D.</p></blockquote><p>Start a new @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combat]{Combat} in the Combat Tracker to indicate the task has started, referring to the appropriate conflict line, based on whether the scene is Standard or Dramatic. Some or all of the letters A through D may appear in the block on the side of the card, along with different problems called Dilemmas. During a DSR a step may only be attempted its letter appears on the card, and each step must be performed in order. So if Step A appears, a Storm Knight may attempt the test that the GM designates for Step A.</p><p>Only one Storm Knight can attempt a step during the round. Others may help by Combining their actions. Each chooses: grant the lead Storm Knight a simple +1 bonus—or attempt the test and grant nothing on a failure, a +1 bonus on a success, +2 on a Good success, or +3 on an Outstanding success. A DSR is an encounter, which means cards may only be played from the Action Pool. See @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combat]{Combat} for more details relating to hands and action pools.</p><p>The Storm Knights should choose who is attempting the step and let anyone else go first to stack up bonuses or get Supporter Destiny Cards into their Action Pools. If the lead fails the skill test can’t be attempted again that round. A different character may take the lead on every round.</p><p>Not all DSRs happen undisturbed. Threats may be attacking the characters, and a combat round may be playing out at the same time as the DSR. The cards in play and number of Possibilities may be even more important than the character’s skills, so be flexible!</p><h3>Multiple Steps</h3><p>If multiple steps are available on the card, the lead Storm Knight may Multi-Action to attempt both steps. Roll a single bonus and apply it to both skill values, with an extra –2 Penalty for each extra action. So if Step A was already resolved and the next Drama Card listed both B and C the character taking the lead that turn could roll once with a –2 penalty and generate a total for steps B and C. Note that a Flurry gives the whole team an extra turn, which means two different steps might be attempted, and a different character might lead the second attempt!</p><h3>Dilemmas</h3><p>If a Dilemma appears on the card it counts as the current step being available (A if you’re just starting, B if you’ve completed A, and so on), but there’s a consequence for failure. Not trying at all for the round counts the same as failing!</p><ul><li><strong>Complication</strong>: Something happens that could potentially make the resolution of the DSR more difficult moving forward. If the step fails all future tests against the DSR suffer a –1 penalty.</li><li><strong>Potential Setback</strong>: Something has happened which will require the party to go back and repeat a previous step. So if the group fails the test for step C during this round, they now must complete step B again instead.</li><li><strong>Critical Problem</strong>: Something happens that threatens to completely undo the characters' progress. If they fail the step during this round, all completed steps are lost.</li></ul><h3>Last Ditch Effort</h3><p>If it’s the fifth round and the steps aren’t present to complete the task, all isn’t lost. The team can try a Last Ditch Effort. This is a Multi-Action that must attempt every remaining step, and suffers an extra –2 penalty. So if steps B, C, and D were still left the Last Ditch Effort would suffer a –6 penalty to all three skills.

      content: "<h1>Managing Cards</h1><p>Card play in the Foundry system is quick and easy, but it does require some set-up by the GM. Below are guides for players and GMs</p><h2>Guide for Players</h2><h3>To Access Your Hand</h3><ul><li>Click on the \"Open Hand\" button at the top of the character sheet, or</li><li>Click on the hand that shows the name of your character in the Card Stacks tab in the side bar</li><li>Click on the Torg button on the left side and then on the hand button that is now showing</li></ul><p><strong>Note:\_</strong>If you get an error message when attempting to open your hand, it means that your GM has not yet set up a hand for you. Ask your GM to set up a hand for your character (instructions for GMs are below).</p><p>You may want to keep your hand open throughout the game so that it will be easy to access your cards.</p><h3>To Draw a Destiny or Cosm Card</h3><p>Click on the appropriate button at the bottom of your hand.</p><h3>To View Your Cards</h3><p>Hover over the thumbnail of the desired card in your hand.</p><h3>To Show a Card to All Other Players</h3><p>Click on the \"broadcast\" icon beside the appropriate card.</p><h3>To Place or Remove a Card from Your Pool</h3><p>Click on the \"In Pool?\" checkbox beside the appropriate card.</p><h3>To Play, Discard, or Pass a Card</h3><p>Click on the appropriate icon beside the card.</p><h3>To See a Card That Another Player Has Played or Discarded</h3><p>Look for a chat message relating to the action taken by the other player. Then, hover over the thumbnail of the card.</p><h3>To See Cards in Other Players Pools</h3><p>Look in the Combat Tracker. Hover your mouse over a card name to see the card.</p><h3>To Flip the Card</h3><p>Click on the up and down arrows on the left of the card to flip it.</p><h3>Enhanced Display</h3><p>To interact with a card during Enhanced Display, you simply have to click on the card and now you get all the options explained until now, you have access to.</p><h2>Guide for GMs</h2><p>Here are some basic tips/instructions for GMs:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Core Card Set</strong> is imported when you first open your world.</li><li>If you want to reset it, you can enter the <strong>Configure Game Settings</strong> and have <strong>Setup the Cards Directory</strong> box checked. After you reload your world (F5), the cards folder will get resetted. <strong>NOTE:</strong> You have uncheck the setting to stop it from resetting.</li><li>You have to check the <strong>Default card deck configuration</strong> (you can access it via <strong>Configure Game Settings</strong> or on the left via the <strong>Torg button</strong> and then the <strong>gear button</strong>. Here you can alocate every card deck/hand/pile as you wish. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If a setting is wrong it is highlighted in red and has to be changed or it won't work.</li><li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Before players can access their hands, you need to set up the player hand. See the section below on setting up player hands for details on how this is done.</li><li>You can freely drag and drop cards between hands, discard piles, and decks. <strong>NOTE:</strong> In Enhanced Display there has to be a card to drag another onto it.</li><li>You can shuffle and reset decks in the appropriate deck window.</li><li>When you initiate a Combat in the Combat Tracker (see @UUID[.Xp1tet83kHrezpIU#combat]{Combat}), a new Drama card will be automatically drawn.</li><li>Click on the \"New\" button in the combat tracker to advance to a new round and draw a new Drama card.</li><li>Click on the \"Keep\" button in the combat tracker to advance to a new round, while keeping the current Drama card.</li><li>The current Drama card is always contained in the Active Drama Card pile. If you make a mistake, or need to substitute a new Drama card for the current round, drag and drop the desired card into the Active Drama Card pile, move the incorrect card to the correct location (discard and/or the deck), and hit the refresh button in the Combat Tracker.</li><li>If you want to reshuffle the contents of a discard pile back into a deck without pulling, you can do so by clicking the reshuffle button in the discard pile.</li><li><strong>Getting Rid of Orphan Cards</strong>. It is recommended that you reset a deck before you delete it. If you don't do this, any cards in player hands and discard piles from that deck will remain. Currently, Foundry doesn't offer a way to get rid of those cards. However, here is the recommended work-around: create a temporary pile or hand and put all of the \"orphanded\" cards in it. Then, delete the temporary pile/hand.</li></ul><h2>Setting Up Player Hands</h2><p>Before a player can access their hand, you must set up their hand for them. Setting up a player hand is a two-step process. First, you need to create a hand for the player's character. Second, you need to give the player permission to access the hand.</p><h3>Creating a Hand</h3><p>The easiest way to create a hand for a character is import the Storm Knight sheet from a compendium. This will create a hand with the correct name, but that hand will still need its permissions changed (see below).</p><p>If the Storm Knight sheet is already imported, you can click on <strong>Create Card Stack</strong>, <strong>Name</strong> it as you wish, set the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Hand</strong> and then finish it with the <strong>Create New Card Stack</strong> button</p><h3>Changing Player Permission</h3><p>To change the permissions for a hand so that a player can access it, do the following:</p><ul><li>Open the Card Stacks tab</li><li>Right click on the hand that contains the name of the player's character</li><li>Click \"Configure Permissions\"</li><li>Find the name of the player, and change the setting to Owner.</li><li>Alternatively, if you want all players to be able to see and change all other players' hands, you can change \"All Players\" to Owner.</li></ul><h1>Storm Knight sheet explained</h1><p>You can switch between the different pages by clicking on the relevant tab on the right of the sheet.</p><h2>Stats</h2><img class=\"imgleft\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/journal/example_sk1.webp\" /><p>This is the main page of the Storm Knight sheet.</p><ul><li><p>On the top you can access you card hand, define your Race and Cosm (Axioms will be automatically defined by the Cosm) and keep track of your Wounds, Shock and Possibilities.</p></li><li><p>The Attributes can be freely modified.</p></li></ul><p>If you Click on the name of an attribute you can make an attribute test.</p><ul><li><p>The Derived Values will be automatically filled.</p></li></ul><p>If you click on Fatigue, you will get assigned the shock.</p><ul><li><p>By clicking on <strong>SKILLS</strong> you can switch between the full skill list and the shorter list of only skills with Adds. You can modify the corresponding attribute, the Adds and if the Skill is favored.</p></li></ul><p>Skill rolls are made by clicking on the Skill name.</p><ul><li><p>The Character portrait can be changed by clicking on it.</p></li><li><p>By clicking on <strong>DEFENSES</strong> you can initiate the <strong>Active Defense</strong> test.

This way you can show them to the players like the images in full journal entries.</p><h2 class=\"passagebreak\">Token settings</h2><img class=\"imgleft\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/journal/example_token1.webp\" /><img class=\"imgright shrink20p\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/journal/example_token2.webp\" /><p>When you click at <strong>Prototype Token</strong> on the top right part of the sheet, you gain access to all the different settings for the corresponding token.</p><p>At Resources you can edit the bars on the top and bottom of the Token. The default setting for this are the wounds and shock values.</p><h1 class=\"passagebreak\">Threat sheet explained</h1><img class=\"imgleft\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/journal/example_npc1.webp\" /><p>The Threat sheet is used for enemies and NPCs.</p><ul><li><p><br />The portrait can be changed on the left top side.</p></li><li><p>Underneath the portrait you have an overview about all the most important stats and can keep track about its current <strong>Wounds</strong>, <strong>Shock</strong> and <strong>Possibilities</strong>.</p></li><li><p>On the top you can define the <strong>Size</strong>, <strong>Threat level</strong> and <strong>Maximum Possibilities</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attributes</strong> can be freely changed and a click on the attribute name starts the test dialoge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Actions</strong> summarizes all the rollable actions that are added under the different tabs. <strong>Unarmed Combat</strong> and the <strong>Interaction attacks</strong> that aren't defined as <strong>Defense Only</strong> under Skills are hardcoded and always available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Skills</strong> are noted as combined values of attribute + skill adds. Skill tests can be made at the summary at the top by clicking on the name. At Defense Only? you can set, which interaction attack is shown under Actions</p></li></ul><p>All the other tabs are used the same way as in the Storm Knights sheet. Abilities replaces the Perks for that matter.</p><h1 class=\"passagebreak\">Vehicle sheet explained</h1><img class=\"imgleft\" src=\"systems/torgeternity/images/journal/example_vehicle1.webp\" /><p>The Vehicles sheet is used for all kind of vehicles and rideable beasts.</p><ul><li><p>Operator is a simple noting who is driving and what its skill is.</p></li><li><p>Only Heavy Weapons and Vehicle Add-ons can be put into a vehicle.</p></li><li><p>If you edit a heavy weapon, you can add Gunner inside the weapon entry.</p></li></ul><h1 class=\"passagebreak\">Data Elements</h1><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently, you cannot modify effects in an item once it is embedded in an actor. Item modifications must be made before you drag them onto an actor. But you can modify the effect transferred by the item on the character, it won't update the item's effect</p><p>One thing important is that when you change a value on a sheet (attribute/adds increase by spending xp for example), disable any effects potentially affecting it, or nothing would really change.</p><p>The following stats are modifiable through the Effects tabs for items and actors.</p><h3>Attributes</h3><p>system.attributes.mindIsFav (Override to 1 for favored)</p><p>This works with each attributes, adding IsFav</p><ul><li>system.attributes.charisma</li><li>system.attributes.dexterity</li><li>system.attributes.mind</li><li>system.attributes.spirit</li><li>system.attributes.strength</li></ul><h3>Skills</h3><p>system.skills.[yourSkillHere].adds (example .alteration., or .waterVehicles.)</p><p>system.skills.[yourSkillHere].isFav (Override to 0 for not favored and 1 for favored)</p><ul><li>system.skills.airVehicles</li><li>system.skills.alteration</li><li>system.skills.apportation</li><li>system.skills.beastRiding</li><li>system.skills.computers</li><li>system.skills.conjuration</li><li>system.skills.divination</li><li>system.skills.dodge</li><li>system.skills.energyWeapons</li><li>system.skills.evidenceAnalysis</li><li>system.skills.faith</li><li>system.skills.find</li><li>system.skills.fireCombat</li><li>system.skills.firstAid</li><li>system.skills.heavyWeapons</li><li>system.skills.intimidation</li><li>system.skills.kinesis</li><li>system.skills.landVehicles</li><li>system.skills.language</li><li>system.skills.lockpicking</li><li>system.skills.maneuver</li><li>system.skills.medicine</li><li>system.skills.meleeWeapons</li><li>system.skills.missileWeapons</li><li>system.skills.persuasion</li><li>system.skills.precognition</li><li>system.skills.profession</li><li>system.skills.reality</li><li>system.skills.scholar</li><li>system.skills.science</li><li>system.skills.stealth</li><li>system.skills.streetwise</li><li>system.skills.survival</li><li>system.skills.taunt</li><li>system.skills.telepathy</li><li>system.skills.trick</li><li>system.skills.unarmedCombat</li><li>system.skills.waterVehicles</li><li>system.skills.willpower</li></ul><h3>Defenses</h3><ul><li>system.dodgeDefenseMod</li><li>system.meleeWeaponsDefenseMod</li><li>system.unarmedCombatDefenseMod</li><li>system.intimidationDefenseMod</li><li>system.maneuverDefenseMod</li><li>system.tauntDefenseMod</li><li>system.trickDefenseMod</li></ul><h3>Others</h3><ul><li>system.other.toughness</li><li>system.other.armor</li><li>system.other.fatigue</li><li>system.shock.max</li><li>system.shock.value</li><li>system.wounds.max</li><li>system.wounds.value</li><li>system.other.cosm</li><li>system.axioms.magic</li><li>system.axioms.social</li><li>system.axioms.spirit</li><li>system.axioms.tech</li><li>system.other.posibilities (not recommended)</li><li>system.xp.unspent</li><li>system.xp.earned</li><li>system.unarmedDamage</li></ul><h3>Movement</h3><ul><li>system.other.moveMod</li><li>system.other.runMode</li></ul><h3>For vehicle</h3><ul><li>system.passengers</li><li>system.topSpeed.kph</li><li>system.maneuver</li><li>system.toughness</li><li>system.armor</li></ul>"
