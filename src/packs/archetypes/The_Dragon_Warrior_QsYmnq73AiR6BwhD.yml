Fell beasts and dark magic ravaged their armies and collapsed their cities.</p><p>The most veteran dwarven warriors died in furious last stands to allow the younger heroes to lead the survivors to the surface, retreating in humiliation before the unstoppable onslaught.\_</p><p>The remaining dwarves sheltered their injured and children in conclaves around Aysle and pledged a grim quest. They formed the Order of the Dragon and vowed to destroy Uthorion, his lieutenants, and all those who served him. Every last one.

The few who remain carry the bitterness and rage of a dying people, and the martial prowess to do something about it. The champions of dwarven-kind, the best of the best, wear special armor to protect and avenge their people.</p>\n<p>Dragon Warrior armor is the ultimate expression of your people’s magic and ingenuity. Each suit is unique, painstakingly forged from rare metals, inscribed with runes, and loaded with advanced weapons and gadgets. The dwarves consider dragons embodiments of rage and power, so it’s no accident these suits are stylized with draconic images and symbols.\_</p>\n<h3>Tactics</h3>\n<p>You’re a heavy-duty front-line fighter. The extremely high Toughness insures many foes can’t even deal Shock damage without a lucky hit or Armor Piercing effects. The great axe makes short work of most\_enemies, and Dragon’s Breath is devastating against groups of opponents with low dodge defenses. Lean on intimidation to make a foe Vulnerable if hitting is difficult, or whenever it’s an Approved Action to gain powerful Destiny cards.</p>\n<h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>\n<p>You’ve likely been a Storm Knight for some time. The crisis may have come during one of the endless battles against Uthorian’s horde, a moment where all seemed lost but you stood fast and held the line against the onslaught. Or perhaps it was a more personal crisis when a clan member or loved one was in dire need of a seemingly impossible rescue.</p>\n<h3>Quote</h3>\n<p>“Actually, most problems can be solved with a battle axe. Let me show you how it works.“</p>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The dwarf inside the armor is likely scarred mentally and physically—though the armor never comes off for anyone to see. Unkempt hair and rough manners are common expressions of the sense of defeat and failure that pervades their shattered culture, leaving most dwarves grim, fatalistic, and rude.</p>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p>Where other Storm Knights usually fight for freedom or ideals, you’re consumed with revenge. Your people are beyond saving, at least as far as most dwarves are concerned, but there’s still time for payback.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Artala, Bran, Gudrun, Gunnar, Isode, Juki the Red, Karn of Ungbar, Milla, Tworek, Zisa</p>\n<h3>Advancement Track (Optional)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Forsaken</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Braided</li>\n<li>(1 XP) <em>first aid</em> +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) <em>reality</em> +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) <em>reality</em> +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) <em>missile weapons</em> +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) <em>melee weapons</em> +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) <em>melee weapons</em> +5</li>\n</ul>"
