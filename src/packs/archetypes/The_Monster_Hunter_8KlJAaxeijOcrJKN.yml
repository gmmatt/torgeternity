      description: "<p>Adventurers of Orrorsh long ago learned lead bullets and steel blades were no match for the horrors of their realm. Alchemy proved a great help to their cause, and some intrepid souls eventually combined that arcane craft with the more practical skill of marksmanship.</p><p>When this Perk is taken, the user has a <q>slayer’s gun</q> and knows how to create various rounds for it. He receives his weapon and the knowledge to make basic metal slugs (damage 14) and any three of the specialized rounds below. Crafted for close encounters, the short-barrel carbine design of the slayer’s gun allows it to be used in melee like a pistol.</p><p>Because the bullets are necessarily large and require exacting specifications, monster hunters who make use of them have standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them—the rounds don’t work in any other kind of weapon.</p><ul><li><strong>Slayer’s Gun:</strong> Range 50/100/200, damage 14, Shots 6</li></ul><p>Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six special bullets as long as they have access to their gear (which always contains a small bullet-making kit). If more rounds are created, they lose the magical essence the Bulletsmith inherently provides and act as regular slugs (damage 14). Replacement rounds may be created between scenes, or during downtime if the Game Master feels it’s appropriate.</p><p>Slayer’s guns are designed to rotate quickly and so can fire any one of their preloaded six chambers (specified before use). Swapping or reloading up to three rounds is an action.</p><p><strong>Slayer’s Bandoleer:</strong> Monster hunters wear a specialized bandoleer designed to hold 18 shells total (12 regular shells and their six special rounds).</p><p><strong>Extra Shells:</strong> This Perk may be taken more than once. Each time after the first the Bulletsmith learns to make a new type of shell and may maintain two more special rounds at a time.</p><p>Here are some of the shells Bulletsmiths have thus far discovered:</p><ul><li><strong>Adamant Shell:</strong> Some of the Victorians’ foes are armored from head to toe with metal, scales, or even a carapace. These shells are designed to cut through them, causing Armor Piercing 4</li><li><strong>Electric Shell:</strong> Water-based creatures or creatures standing in water take an additional +4 damage when hit by electric shells. A previously unknown side-effect of these rounds is that they can cause glitches in high-tech <em>electronic</em> equipment. Robots and machines take the extra damage, and sensitive equipment shorts out and is inoperable for three rounds</li><li><strong>Explosive Shell:</strong> The most dangerous of the Bullet Smith’s shells causes damage 15 in a Small Blast Radius</li><li><strong>Giant Killer Shell:</strong> The Victorians developed these heavy shells to take down the Gaunt Man’s biggest horrors. They cause +5 damage against Large or greater creatures</li><li><strong>Holy Water Shell:</strong> +2 damage versus any supernaturally evil creature, including gospog, vampires, and undead</li><li><strong>Phantom Shell:</strong> These rounds are made from various reagents such as cold iron, salt, and holy water that allows them to affect ethereal creatures normally</li><li><strong>Silver Shell:</strong> Creatures with the Lycanthrope Special Ability take +4 damage from silver shells</li><li><strong>Sun Shell:</strong> These rounds contain something the alchemists call <q>liquid sunlight.</q> They explode with ultraviolet light in a Medium Blast, causing any creatures <q>hit</q> by them to be Very Vulnerable if they have a sensitivity to light or sunlight.

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>You are a Victorian, and your world, Gaea, is caught in the grip of the
      Gaunt Man’s horrors. You weren’t content to be ruled by terror, and so you
      fought back. Against all odds you survived, and the various tricks,
      gadgets, and special weapons you’ve acquired over years of battling evil
      have evened the odds considerably.</p>

      <p>When the Gaunt Man gathered his dark forces to travel through the
      maelstrom bridges and unleash their fury upon Core Earth, you followed to
      stalk them, just as you’ve always done.</p>

      <h3>Tactics</h3>

      <p>The special shells in your Slayer’s Gun gives you power and flexibility
      against specific foes, even outside of Orrorsh. Whenever you can,
      investigate what types of foes are likely to appear and prepare a custom
      load of shells to deal with them. Holy Water shells work well against
      gospog, a common enemy employed by all the High Lords. Even once all your
      specialized shells are used, your standard ammunition still packs a
      punch.</p>

      <p>You are highly resistant to fear and intimidation, but extremely
      vulnerable to taunt interactions. Victorians are notoriously haughty and
      intolerant of insults!</p>

      <h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>

      <p>Your crisis came long ago on Gaea. Maybe it was a werewolf, or perhaps
      it was a vampire. Whatever it was, it was a product of the Gaunt Man’s
      evil. Tracking it back to its lair was foolhardy, but your attempt
      triggered a change in you. As a Storm Knight you finally had the power to
      fight back.</p>

      <h3>Quote</h3>

      <p>“It’s easier to stop fearing a thing once you have the power to destroy
      it.“</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Battling monsters is a dangerous profession, and you bear numerous
      scars attesting to that fact. Only some of those scars are visible.
      Victorians prefer modest dress, even in excruciating heat, and you’re no
      exception. Your distinctive coat made of strange leather and the ornately
      decorated, oversized Slayer’s Gun you carry are both giveaways to your
      profession.</p>

      <h3>Agenda</h3>
