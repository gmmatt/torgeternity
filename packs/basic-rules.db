Carrying it creates a “Contradiction”, which means he’s out of step with reality at risk of @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.OuHaBxUl8n5lojot]{Disconnection}.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Axiom</strong>: The low number means higher level civilization isn’t supported here. Democracy doesn’t make sense to people attuned to the realm…but following the strongest hunter and taking what you want does! If any Storm Knight had Psionic powers, they would be contradictory here.</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Axiom</strong>: The high number means faith has tangible effects in the Living Land. Gods are real, and praying for miracles works without contradiction!</li>\n<li><strong>Tech Axiom</strong>: This is the number most of the Storm Knights present care about. Advanced technology is contradictory here. Each character has an Axiom listed for their items. If the number is above 6 the item is a Contradiction within the Living Land, so using it opens the character to the possibility of Disconnection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>World Laws</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Law of Savagery</strong>: When battle rages, things get bloody in the Living Land. Don’t dwell on the exact meaning of this rule until combat starts. </li>\n<li><strong>Law of Life:</strong> Wounds heal quickly here, and dead matter decomposes rapidly as well. It’s unlikely for this rule to come up during the game, but if it does, see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.4hN0xAsql86XWwEY]{Defeat}.</li>\n<li><strong>Law of Wonders</strong>: Lost things turn up unexpectedly in the Living Land, and stone and metal buildings that would normally crumble into rubble tend to remain standing as vine covered monoliths instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ew09Zjnywuwxkm9p"}}}

Any Contradictory items become unusable as they phase in and out of existence. That means high–tech weapon attacks become impossible for a Disconnected character, and modern armor temporarily disappears and provides no protection. At the beginning of a Disconnected character’s turn the player rolls a reality skill test against DN 14. If the test succeeds the Storm Knight immediately reconnects, equipment returns to normal, and Possibility energy may be used once more. If the test fails the character remains Disconnected.

{"_id":"S5wSL3nDkI2GGoun","name":"Dramatic Skill Resolution","content":"<p>In Torg Eternity, a particulaly tense situation can be played out as a Dramatic Skill Resolution. The team has five rounds (i.e., five Drama Cards) to complete the mission, which consists of four different steps. After five rounds, the dramatic skill resolution results in a failure. However if the team completes all four steps in five rounds or fewer they succeed. The steps for the task are desiganted as Step A through Step D. The GM will determine the nature and difficulty at each step of the skill test.</p>\n<p>Flip over a new @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Card} to indicate the task has started, referring to the appropriate conflict line, based on whether the scene is Standard or Dramatic. Some or all of the letters A through D may appear in the block on the side of the card, along with different problems called Dilemmas. During a DSR a step may only be attempted its letter appears on the card, and each step must be performed in order. So if Step A appears, a Storm Knight may attempt the test that the GM designates for Step A.</p>\n<p>Only one Storm Knight can attempt a step during the round. Others may help by Combining their actions. Each chooses: grant the lead Storm Knight a simple +1 bonus—or attempt the test and grant nothing on a failure, a +1 bonus on a success, +2 on a Good success, or +3 on an Outstanding success. A DSR is an encounter, which means cards may only be played from the Action Pool. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat} for more details relating to hands and action pools.</p>\n<p>The Storm Knights should choose who is attempting the step and let anyone else go first to stack up bonuses or get Supporter Destiny Cards into their Action Pools. If the lead fails the skill test can’t be attempted again that round. A different character may take the lead on every round.</p>\n<p>Not all DSRs happen undisturbed. Threats may be attacking the characters, and a combat round may be playing out at the same time as the DSR. The cards in play and number of Possibilities may be even more important than the character’s skills, so be flexible!</p>\n<h3>Multiple Steps</h3>\n<p>If multiple steps are available on the card, the lead Storm Knight may Multi-Action to attempt both steps. Roll a single bonus and apply it to both skill values, with an extra –2 Penalty for each extra action. So if Step A was already resolved and the next Drama Card listed both B and C the character taking the lead that turn could roll once with a –2 penalty and generate a total for steps B and C. Note that a Flurry gives the whole team an extra turn, which means two different steps might be attempted, and a different character might lead the second attempt!</p>\n<h3>Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>If a Dilemma appears on the card it counts as the current step being available (A if you’re just starting, B if you’ve completed A, and so on), but there’s a consequence for failure. Not trying at all for the round counts the same as failing!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complication</strong>: Something happens that could potentially make the resolution of the DSR more difficult moving forward. If the step fails all future tests against the DSR suffer a –1 penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Setback</strong>: Something has happened which will require the party to go back and repeat a previous step. So if the group fails the test for step C during this round, they now must complete step B again instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Problem</strong>: Something happens that threatens to completely undo the characters' progress. If they fail the step during this round, all completed steps are lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Last Ditch Effort</h3>\n<p>If it’s the fifth round and the steps aren’t present to complete the task, all isn’t lost. The team can try a Last Ditch Effort. This is a Multi-Action that must attempt every remaining step, and suffers an extra –2 penalty. So if steps B, C, and D were still left the Last Ditch Effort would suffer a –6 penalty to all three skills. Choose the lead for this last attempt carefully!</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.QjqWpTVssz8tZ3kb"}}}
{"_id":"UdOHo3I4piwEd6vO","name":"Interaction Attack","content":"<p>Interaction attacks may be based on any of the following for skills: <em>intimidation </em>(threatening foes), <em>maneuver </em>(feinting and weaving), <em>taunt </em>(verbal goading), and <em>trick </em>(clever uses of the environment).

The DN for the test is equal to the target’s total in the same skill, so trick vs trick, maneuver vs maneuver, etc. If the attacker succeeds the target is either Stymied (–2 on tests) or Vulnerable (all attacks and interactions are +2 against that target) until the end of their next turn. On a Good success the target is Very Stymied (–4) or Very Vulnerable (+4), or both Stymied (–2) and Vulnerable (+2)…attackers choice! An Outstanding result is called a Player’s Call. The Good effect still applies, plus the player and GM negotiate an additional effect. This might be as potent as a weaker foe fleeing the battle or being taken out by the environment. A stronger foe might not be completely removed by a Player’s Call, but should suffer either a permanent effect or at least losing an action. </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.sFKinwBNA5eTFoNT"}}}

{"_id":"YkPR3np1UePORPcV","name":"Combat","content":"<p>Combat rounds in Torg Eternity are ten seconds long. During that time, each character can move and perform one or more actions.</p>\n<h3>Initiative: How to Use the Drama Cards </h3>\n<p>In order to determine the order in which the players and threats will act, the GM draws and displays a @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Card}. When playing in Foundry, we recommend that the GM display the Drama Card on the tabletop.</p>\n<p>The Drama card includes two conflict lines. One applies to combat rounds that take place in Standard Scenes and the other applies to combat rounds that take place in Dramatic scenes (see the @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.EDI95jBrQruLzDXr]{Basic Rules Home Page} for more on Standard and Dramatic scenes). The conflict line indicates whether the Heroes (H) or the Villains (V) go first. The conflict line may also include conditions that affect one or both sides. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Cards} for a description of what each condition means.</p>\n<p>When the heroes take their turn, each character may act in any order desired. Likewise, all threats may act in any order that the GM determines.</p>\n<p><strong>Surprise. </strong>If the GM determines that one side is surprised, that side is not allowed to act during the combat round if the combat line shows that they should go first. ! </p>\n<p>Once everyone has finished taking a turn, the round is complete. Flip over a new Drama Card for the next round.</p>\n<h3>The Action Pool</h3>\n<p>Until an encounter begins there’s no limit on trading or playing Destiny Cards. However, once battle is joined things get trickier! Cards may only be played or traded from each character’s Action Pool, and that pool starts off empty. At the end of each turn after the character acts, the player may put one Destiny Card in their pool by \"marking\" it in their hand (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}). The card may then be played immediately, or at any time after that. Putting a card in the Action Pool isn’t playing it. Instead, it makes the card available for play.  </p>\n<h3>The Character Turn</h3>\n<p>When a hero (or threat) takes their turn, they can move up to their walking or running speed (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.prbDBaVAlMkytvbo]{Moving} for more details).
