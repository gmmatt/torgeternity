Strange bridges descended from the sky in various places around the planet, and where they landed reality itself bent and changed. Invaders crossed the bridges and now they&rsquo;re turning Earth into something else, piece by piece. The clash of realities creates storms, and a few special people are changed by the storm. They become heroes, the best version of themselves from this or an alternate reality. You and those seated in this room are some of those people.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The base Foundry system for Torg Eternity includes 16 archetype characters as a part of its built-in compendium. Have each player select from among the following archetypes by dragging the archetype from the compendium into the Actor tab: Electric Samurai, Reality Raider, Prmitive Warrior, Masked Crusader and/or Monster Hunter. Other archetypes can be used, but detailed instructions on how to handle them are not incluced in this adventure. The background tab of each character sheet explains who the character is, and what they do. Have each player select a name for their character, and let them describe who is seated in the briefing room and greet one another. Delay any questions about what statistics mean or what the Tactics section refers to for now.</p>\n<p>On each sheet call everyone&rsquo;s attention to the Moment of Crisis. This is the exact instant the hero changed from an ordinary person into a Storm Knight. This happens when a person is faced with danger and makes an active choice to help others or fight to repulse an invading reality. When this happens raw energy floods into the hero, and they gain the power to bend reality to their own will. In game terms that means they each get Possibility tokens and a hand of Destiny cards.</p>\n<h3>Possibility Energy</h3>\n<p>Each player should set their availiable possiblities to three (3). They can spend these to avoid damage or boost their dice rolls. Don&rsquo;t explain the specifics of either of those uses yet, but this indicates the amount of power they have to &ldquo;push back&rdquo; against reality. When a player does something that delights everyone at the table, give them another Possibility point as a reward. Note: The Realm Runner starts with four possibilities instead of three.</p>\n<h3>Destiny Cards</h3>\n<p>Each player should draw four (4) Destiny cards. For detailed instructions on how this is done, see @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}.</p>\n<p>Each card explains what it does, but may not make sense until the first tests below. Outside of combat these cards may be played or traded between players (one for one) at any time.</p>\n<h2>THE MISSION BRIEFING</h2>\n<p>An officer (Captain McDonnell if asked) briefs the Storm Knights on the mission. Read the following aloud.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Delphi Council has asked us to support a reconnaissance mission into the alien zone that&rsquo;s taken over both coastlines of North America. The &lsquo;Living Land&rsquo; they&rsquo;re calling it. If we send regular troops into the zone their weapons malfunction and some even revert to a primitive mental state. But you Storm Knights aren&rsquo;t as severely affected by altered reality, so we&rsquo;re depending on you. These invading zones are bordered by stone monoliths called stelae. We&rsquo;re studying these stelae to figure out how we can use them against the invaders&mdash;but first we have to locate them!</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your mission is simple, but not necessarily easy. We have a converted tour boat for you to take inland. Get as far as you can up the Columbia river, past the ruins of Astoria. There are survivors living there who got word of a stela somewhere inland, maybe a backup of some kind. When you reach the wreckage of the Route 433 bridge go ashore, find that stela, and determine if it&rsquo;s just stone or something else. Don&rsquo;t try to destroy it at this time, we just want its coordinates and a &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; from Storm Knights on whether it&rsquo;s dangerous or not.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any questions?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Potential Questions and Answers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What can we expect in the Living Land?</strong> Conditions and brutal and primitive. Technology much beyond spears and bows doesn&rsquo;t work for ordinary people&mdash;at least not for long&mdash;and metal rusts at an accelerated rate if left unattended. Most affected humans become ruled by instinct and savage impulses. The invaders there are lizardmen known as edeinos. Oh, and watch out for the dinosaurs.</li>\n<li><strong>What about the survivors in Astoria? </strong>They have a walled community built around a house made famous by some movie. Some landmarks resist the change in reality, and around them are pockets of unaltered &ldquo;Core Earth&rdquo; where people can stay. Astoria has one of these.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the boat armed?</strong> No, but you Storm Knights are. This is a reconnaissance mission, not an assault, and this is just a converted tourist boat meant for transportation and little else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once any questions are answered, proceed to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.LqYEn2OP1Oxe9XNi]{03 - Scene One: The Journey Begins}.</p>"}

They all get to roll a test for that shortly.</p>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Your boat motors past the crumbling ruins of Astoria. A few vine&ndash;covered skyscrapers remain standing in the distance. Pterodactyls swoop around them and nest in the upper floors. The rest of the city is nothing but ruins covered by a thick canopy of jungle. It&rsquo;s as if the city were bombed a hundred years ago and nature has reclaimed the remains&mdash;except it happen practically overnight. It&rsquo;s hot and humid in the Living Land, even though the air at sea was cold and brisk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The jungle trees are massive, and branches stretch all the way across the wide Columbia river to form a dense canopy overhead. Vines dangle down into the river and an occasional low&ndash;hanging branch scrapes alone the side of the vessel as it moves upriver.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>FIRST TESTS</h2>\n<p>Have each character make a find test to see if they spot trouble while moving up the river. Have every character complete the test as described below, just to teach how tests work.&nbsp; This is a fundamental game mechanic and comes up often, so take the time to get everyone used to it now!</p>\n<h3>Skill Bases</h3>\n<p>Every character has a find skill, found in their list of skills on the character sheet.Each skill starts with a base, determined by the appropriate attribute. For find, that&rsquo;s Mind. Then there are a number of &lsquo;skill adds&rsquo; that get added to the attribute, usually one to three, to give a total found to the right. The number to the right is the one that matters, but it&rsquo;s worth breaking down where that number comes from! For example, The Realm Runner has a Mind of 8, and +1 add in find, for a total base of 9.</p>\n<h3>Dice Rolls</h3>\n<p>The player should click on the Find skill on their character sheet. This will roll a d20, and then generate a number called an Action Total. Both the d20 roll and the action total will be displayed in chat.</p>\n<p>The Torg Eternity system calculates the Action Total by doing the following: it compares the number to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.BGpU76zitnb1LnzH]{The Bonus Chart}. The number generated is called the Bonus, and gets added to the base above for a final value. Note that the Bonus may be negative! A 1 on the first die always fails. A 10 or 20 is special. Roll another d20 and add the result to the first. A 1 on these extra dice doesn&rsquo;t automatically fail, but another 10 or 20 does generate another extra die roll! Added together dice can generate a huge bonus&mdash;the chart goes to 60 and beyond!</p>\n<h3>Unskilled Tests</h3>\n<p>Everyone has find, but for other tests it may matter if a character has adds in the skill or not. If not a roll is still possible, just use the attribute for the base, but without adds the test is labelled as Unskilled: a result of 10 generates another die as usual, but a result of 20 does not.</p>\n<h3>Difficulty Number (DN)</h3>\n<p>The target Difficulty Number (DN) for any test is 10 unless otherwise specified. If the base plus bonus equals 10 or more, the test is a success. If the result is less than 10 the test failed. Generating a result that&rsquo;s five or more than the DN is a Good result, and may have extra effects. Generating a result 10 or more beyond the DN is an Outstanding result. Thus for this find test, a total of 10&ndash;14 is a success, 15&ndash;19 is a Good success, and 20+ is Outstanding.</p>\n<h3>Bonuses add to Bonuses: The Bonus Chart</h3>\n<p>Players may wish to play a Destiny card at this point to improve their tests. An Action or Willpower card adds a +3 bonus, or a Supporter card adds a +3 bonus to someone else&rsquo;s test. To do so, click on the +3 Card button at the bottom of the chat message that displays the original action total. Note that the +3 is to the Bonus generated&hellip;not the result of the dice. Likewise if a character declared they were messing around and not paying attention the GM may apply a &ndash;2 Penalty to the find test, affecting the end result but not the die roll.</p>\n<h3>Dice Add to Dice: Spending Possibilities</h3>\n<p>If someone rolls poorly now is a great time to introduce one function of the Possibility points that each player has. Spend a point and click on the Possibility button at the end of the chat message showing your action total to roll another d20 and ADD the result to the first one! If this new die rolls less than a 10, Foundry will treat it as minimum +10 instead. If it rolls an actual 10 or 20, it will add another die roll as usual! Foundry will automatically recheck the Bonus Chart to get the new number to add to the base. Remember, a bonus like +3 or &ndash;2 adds to the final result, never the die rolls&hellip;but new dice from 10s, 20s, or Possibilities always add together to generate the value from the Bonus Chart.</p>\n<h3>Failure</h3>\n<p>If a character fails this test they are Stymied, a condition that gives them a &ndash;2 on all tests until the end of their next Action.</p>\n<h3>Success (10 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Anyone that generates a total of 10 or more on their find test sees a logjam of flotsam, decomposing jungle foliage, and scattered human bodies washing downriver. The boat easily maneuvers to avoid the larger logs, but the corpses begin to scream and clamber up onto the ship&rsquo;s deck! Combat begins as below, but at least the character is ready.</p>\n<h3>Good (15 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Just like a success, but the character saw the twitching limbs of the corpses and realized early that these weren&rsquo;t dead bodies, they were Gospog! Gospog are horrifying creatures made by the invaders by planting strange seeds in the bodies of those killed during the invasion. When the Gospog begin to scream any character with a Good success or better gets a +2 bonus on the Fear test (see below).</p>\n<h3>Outstanding (20 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Like a Good success, but the character was on guard enough to warn the boat to maneuver enough away from the bodies that the gospog take extra time getting aboard. When the Encounter starts (see below) if the Villains would have acted first they merely arrive around the ship rather than gaining actions. If a character has an Alertness Destiny Card and wants to spend it, treat it as if someone got an Outstanding result!</p>\n<h2>FIRST ENCOUNTER</h2>\n<p>Gospog lurch into the boat, trying to bite and rend the flesh of the living! There are two Gospog of the First Planting for each hero present. The first thing to do is to draw a Drama card and place it on the desktop to set the initiative and any special conditions for the turn.</p>\n<p>There are two Gospog of the First Planting for each Storm Knight. Drag and drop the Gospog from the Actor tab onto the outside of the boat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-actors.muGYv1XZDojsyEfv]{Gospog of the First Planting}(2 per Storm Knight).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you should show the @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.6VffoCRaJ8eZOPi1]{Gospog Threat Stand} to the players.</p>\n<h3>Drama Cards</h3>\n<p>Torg Eternity is played in scenes, and each scene is either Standard or Dramatic. This is a Standard Scene, so check whether the Heroes act first or the Villains do. Note that if anyone gained an Outstanding result on the find test the villains don&rsquo;t get to act if they go first! When the heroes go, each may act in any order desired, just coordinate with one another. Once everyone has finished acting the round is complete, flip over a new Drama Card for the next round.</p>\n<p>On the same line of the card that says which side acts first, you may see a condition that affects the entire side. See @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Cards} for a description of what each condition means.</p>\n<h3>The Action Pool</h3>\n<p>Until an encounter begins there&rsquo;s no limit on trading or playing Destiny Cards. However, once battle is joined things get trickier! Cards may only be played or traded from each character&rsquo;s Action Pool, and that pool starts off empty. At the end of each turn after the character acts, the player may put one Destiny Card in their pool by marking it (see @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}). It may be played immediately, or at any time after that. Putting a card in the Action Pool isn&rsquo;t playing it, but now it&rsquo;s available to be played or traded!</p>\n<h3>Basic Actions</h3>\n<p>When the heroes (or the Gospog) act they have several basic options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.prbDBaVAlMkytvbo]{Moving} involves walking or running up to the speed on their character sheet.</li>\n<li>An @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.5ax6sbR4BFCqp7IN]{Attack}, which attempts to physically damage a target.</li>\n<li>The Storm Knight may also @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.sHmYbJh6Wu7E9ayo]{Defend}, in a concentrated effort to avoid damage.</li>\n<li>An @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.UdOHo3I4piwEd6vO]{Interaction Attack} attempts to place the opponent at a disadvantage using cunning words and/or actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a Storm Knight or Gospog is hit, follow the rules for @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.JN6ZbILajAthoEBS]{Damage}.</p>\n<p>Other rules that may come into play during the encounter include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.B2TKLzGGeXvc1ZU1]{Multi-Actions} apply when a character attempts more than one action at once.</li>\n<li>A Storm Knight or Gospog may also attack @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.qCTdErWd4Yq5gH9h]{Multi-Targets}.</li>\n<li>A Storm Knight may have a weapon that does @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.plqbdUM5mBUfGxdu]{Armor Piercing} damage.</li>\n<li>A Storm Knight may have a firearm that utilizes the @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.7Af9s2g1GlkytrNY]{Short Burst}.</li>\n<li>A Primitive Warrior may want to utilize her @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.t4psjpSrhSSYXxOQ]{Sabretooth Cat}.</li>\n<li>If a Storm Knight using any high-tech equipment (over Tech Level 7) rolls a 1, that character must test for @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.OuHaBxUl8n5lojot]{Disconnection}.</li>\n<li>If a Storm Knight sufferws more than three wounds, the Storm Knight must test for @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.4hN0xAsql86XWwEY]{Defeat}.</li>\n<li>When attacking with Gospog, the GM may want to consider utilizing a @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.wa3TfGPytgJyjSFO]{Combined Attack}.</li>\n<li>If a Storm Knight attempts to fire a gun or other ranged attack into melee combat, they take a risk of injuring an ally by @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.LEEgqVrw5S1BDd7a]{Friendly Fire}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>THE END OF THE BATTLE</h2>\n<p>When the last Gospog is defeated everyone unmarks any cards left in their Action Pools. If a player has more than four cards, discard down to four. This marks the end of the scene, so any player with fewer than four cards draws back up to four. Any Shock suffered recovers automatically.</p>\n<p>Proceed to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.jpwOVLoQXh4xjn7q]{04 - Scene Two: Land Ho!}.</p>"}

This is a Dramatic Scene, and the Storm Knights can feel the tension in the air as they begin their search for the stela.</p>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;No enemies greet you at the shore, but tracks of the large, three toed feet of edeinos abound, and the distant roar of a massive dinosaur hints of dangers lurking among the massive jungle trees. The situation is tricky. There are hundreds of edeinos in the area. The Storm Knights must follow the trails in the area and find the stela before the majority of the creatures find them!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this Torg Eternity scene, use the Main Foundry scene that is included with this module.</p>\n<h2>FIRST DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION</h2>\n<p>In Torg Eternity, a situation like this can be played out as a Dramatic Skill Resolution. The team has five rounds (Drama Cards) to complete the mission, which consists of four different steps. After five rounds, enough edeinos flood the area that the Storm Knights must retreat to the boat in failure. However if the team completes all four steps in five rounds or fewer they escape back to the boat before any large warbands arrive. The steps for the task are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A</strong>: Follow the trails to the correct area. This is a <em>tracking </em>test, DN 10. Most of the heroes don&rsquo;t have tracking, but they could still make the attempt (Unskilled) using <em>Mind </em>with no adds.</li>\n<li><strong>B</strong>: Sneak past the main edeinos encampment to the stela&rsquo;s location. This is a challenging (DN 12) <em>stealth </em>test. If a character doesn&rsquo;t have <em>stealth</em>, <em>Dexterity </em>is the attribute for Unskilled attempts.</li>\n<li><strong>C</strong>: Cut through the thick underbrush to reach the stela. This is a DN 10 <em>survival </em>test. Survival is based on <em>Mind</em>. Note that the Realm Runner has a Machete which makes <em>survival </em>Favored. On a Favored test, if you don&rsquo;t like the first die roll, you may roll again&mdash;but you must accept the new result, even if it&rsquo;s worse!</li>\n<li><strong>D</strong>: Sense whether the stela is active, or has any special defenses. This is a DN 14 <em>reality </em>test. Every Storm Knight has reality, which is based on <em>Spirit</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flip over a new Drama Card to indicate the task has started. This is a Dramatic Scene now, so use the Dramatic line for initiative and effects. The block on the side that was ignored earlier now becomes critical. Letters A through D may appear there, along with different problems called Dilemmas. During a DSR a step may only be attempted its letter appears on the card, and each step must be performed in order. So if Step A appears, a Storm Knight may attempt the <em>tracking </em>test.</p>\n<p>Only one Storm Knight can attempt a step during the round. Others may help by Combining their actions. Each chooses: grant the lead Storm Knight a simple +1 bonus&mdash;or attempt the test and grant nothing on a failure, a +1 bonus on a success, +2 on a Good success, or +3 on an Outstanding success. A DSR is an encounter, which means cards may only be played from the Action Pool.</p>\n<p>The Storm Knights should choose who is attempting the step and let anyone else go first to stack up bonuses or get Supporter Destiny Cards into their Action Pools. If the lead fails the skill test can&rsquo;t be attempted again that round. A different character may take the lead on every round.</p>\n<p>Also, this DSR isn&rsquo;t happening undisturbed. Small bands of edeinos to skirmish with the Storm Knights, see below. Some of the band must fight off the villains while others work on completing the task. The cards in play and number of Possibilities may be even more important than the character&rsquo;s skills, so be flexible!</p>\n<h3>Multiple Steps</h3>\n<p>If multiple steps are available on the card, the lead Storm Knight may Multi-Action to attempt both steps. Roll a single bonus and apply it to both skill values, with an extra &ndash;2 Penalty for each extra action. So if Step A was already resolved and the next Drama Card listed both B and C the character taking the lead that turn could roll once with a &ndash;2 penalty and generate a total for both stealth and survival. Note that a Flurry gives the whole team an extra turn, which means two different steps might be attempted, and a different character might lead the second attempt!</p>\n<h3>Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>If a Dilemma appears on the card it counts as the current step being available (A if you&rsquo;re just starting, B if you&rsquo;ve completed A, and so on), but there&rsquo;s a consequence for failure. Not trying at all for the round counts the same as failing!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complication</strong>: A strange mist creeps through the valley with the stela, making navigation much harder depending on where the group is approaching from. If the step fails all future tests against the DSR suffer a &ndash;1 penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Setback</strong>: A larger warband arrives in the area and the heroes must flee and find another route. The last step that was completed is lost. So if the group was testing for step C they now must complete step B again instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Problem</strong>: The edeinos swarm the area in numbers, drawn by the noise and activity. The Storm Knights must circle around completely to try again. Any completed steps are lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Last Ditch Effort</h3>\n<p>If it&rsquo;s the fifth round and the steps aren&rsquo;t present to complete the task, all isn&rsquo;t lost. The team can try a Last Ditch Effort. This is a Multi-Action that must attempt every remaining step, and suffers an extra &ndash;2 penalty. So if steps B, C, and D were still left the Last Ditch Effort would suffer a &ndash;6 penalty to all three skills. Choose the lead for this last attempt carefully!</p>\n<h2>EDEINOS SKIRMISHERS</h2>\n<p>To complicate the Dramatic Skill Resolution above, edeinos skirmishers harass the heroes at every step of the way, hoping to delay them until the main warband arrives. At the start of the first round place one Edeinos Warrior for each Storm Knight on the table. Even though there is no map for this scene, placing tokens is a good way to help the players keep track how many edeinos are present and roughly where they are. The edeinos emerge from the thick jungle about 10 meters away from the Storm Knights. On their first turn they move halfway towards the heroes and throw spears (missile weapons), and then move into melee combat range on subsequent turns. If Attack is an Approved Action they run to get into melee range so they can All-Out Attack!</p>\n<p>Each round, at the beginning, another two Edeinos Warriors appear to join the battle. If the heroes suffer a Setback four warriors appear instead! If the villains suffer a setback they receive no reinforcements. If the villains act first, one of the warriors may attempt an Interaction Attack against the lead Storm Knight to Stymie (&ndash;2) attempts to gain steps!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-actors.IE5R3CvPVcYV2Plv]{Edeinos Warrior} (1 per Storm Knight)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-actors.IE5R3CvPVcYV2Plv]{Edeinos Warrior} (2 at the beginning of each subsequent round)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the Edeinos Warriors appear, show the players the @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.DPvuF0KOmThb6aao]{Edeinos Threat Stand}.</p>\n<h3>Mobs</h3>\n<p>Unlike the Gospog, edeinos suffer Shock. With lots of villains on the table it&rsquo;s recommended that the GM takes any Shock damage in one pile, and every time 10 Shock accumulates remove the most appropriate warrior, usually the one who was last attacked. A blow that Defeats an edeinos with a Wound doesn&rsquo;t affect this pile one way or another</p>\n<h2>IF THE DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION FAILS</h2>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;More and more scaly lizardmen burst through the trees each second, and it&rsquo;s clear the only chance for survival is to run back to the boat as quickly as possible and flee the area. There are cries and thrown spears clatter off the sides of the vessel as it speeds downriver back towards the coast, but everyone makes it aboard and back to the carrier. You&rsquo;re disappointed that you didn&rsquo;t get close enough to learn about the stela, but there will be other missions, other chances to show the invaders that they aren&rsquo;t invincible.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>IF THE DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION SUCCEEDS</h2>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;As you get near the stone monolith you can feel a low, pulsing energy within it, similar to what you feel crossing into the Living Land. As you reach out towards it words and images start flooding into your mind. Backup. This would mark a boundary for the Living Land if one of the main stelae were uprooted. They CAN be uprooted. Devastation. The transformation back to Core Earth reality is violent and obliterates the ordinary people inside the area who have transformed&mdash;unless the Storm Knights have flooded the area with Possibility Energy first. The energy that comes from stories, stories of hope and resistance. The same energy that these stelae slowly absorb and send&hellip;somewhere. As you concentrate you feel it, this stela is attached to a network that stretches out in every direction. A spider&rsquo;s web. And at the center of the web a presence of absolute darkness. You hear the name Rec Pakken in whispers, and with a shiver you feel that the darkness is now looking directly at you!</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You break connection quickly. It&rsquo;s time to go. Reinforcements are coming, and not just the army of edeinos camped nearby. Everyone rushes back to the boat with edeinos scouts close behind, but you all board and flee downriver before the forces of darkness can strike. You&rsquo;ve learned something about the invaders, and have the exact location of this backup stela marked. With this information you and the Delphi Council can start the long fight to reclaim the Earth!&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>"}

Every extra target for the attack is a &ndash;2 penalty, so attempting to trick three Gospog at once is a &ndash;4 penalty. Roll <em><strong>once</strong></em>, apply the bonus, then compare the result to each target&rsquo;s Defense separately and resolve the effects individually. This a good concept to introduce during the second round of combat, once players have gotten comfortable with regular attacks and tests.&nbsp;</p>"}

It&rsquo;s designed to walk both the GM and the players through the rules and Founrdy system together, adding layers as it goes. This gives a general feel for gameplay, but there are many more character options and realms to explore in the full game!&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Setting Up</h2>\n<p>Before you begin play, you will need to prepare the Destiny Deck and the Living Land Cosm deck:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure that you have installed the basic Drama Deck, the basic Destiny Deck, and the Living Land cosm deck. This can be done from the System Settings menu.</li>\n<li>After all players are logged in the Foundry game, but before beginning play, be sure that your players have full access to the Destiny deck and the Living Land Cosm deck. To to so, go to the settings tab for the Unofficial Card Support module and click on Deck Settings. From there, make sure all your players are allowed access to draw, view, and discard. Details on how to manage the decks can be found in @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}.</li>\n<li>For this Quickstart, delete the following cards from the Destiny Deck: Martyr, Flurry, Master Plan, Connection, Idea, Attuned, Glory, Romance, Nemesis, Reality Surge, and Maelstrom. The quickest way to do this is to take all of those cards into your own hand and then delete each one.</li>\n<li>After you have taken the above steps, shuffle the Destiny Deck and the Living Land Cosm deck.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To get started with the adventure, proceed to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.4g5ZJWG18rjdUQ2P]{02 - Introduction}.</p>","img":""}

Cosm Cards don&rsquo;t need to go into the Action Pool, that&rsquo;s just for Destiny Cards. Depending upon which cards are played, an adventure can turn out very differently! Here&rsquo;s a few hints on how to handle the Cosm Cards within this adventure.</p>\n<h3>Dino Attack!</h3>\n<p>The dreaded Tyrannosaur stalks the area. Even if the card is played early, the GM may have it appear at any time during the act, so don&rsquo;t have it attack the boat. The best time for an appearance is on the second round of the Dramatic Skill Resolution. It focuses on the heroes, but it may gobble up an edeinos or two if they suffer a Setback!</p>\n<h3>Lost Treasure</h3>\n<p>An out of place rubber muck boot lying in the mud draws attention. Upon investigation it turns out the boot is filled with gold dust. A Storm Knight with a successful DN 14 scholar (based on Mind) test might remember doubtful legends of such a boot lost in 1857. The gold has no effect on this adventure, but the Delphi Council or the Storm Knights might get use out of it later!</p>\n<h3>Law of Decay</h3>\n<p>In general award no Possibilities if the item chosen is cosmetic or unlikely to impact the adventure. Award 1 Possibility for backup weapons or ammunition. Award 2 Possibilities for most Armor, the Realm Runner&rsquo;s special items, or the Machete since it&rsquo;s survival boost might come in handy during the Dramatic Skill Resolution. A character&rsquo;s trademark weapon or Armor that provides +4 protection is worth 3 Possibilities!</p>\n<h3>Perils of the Living Land</h3>\n<p>The river is blocked by a new waterfall that the boat can&rsquo;t navigate. Award each Storm Knight 1 Possibility for the trouble, but they&rsquo;ve got a longer hike ahead of them to reach the stelae. Have them attempt a DN 14 survival test (one leader, others may do a @Compendium[world.up-the-creek.wa3TfGPytgJyjSFO]{Combined Attack}). If it fails, each Storm Knight suffers a Fatigue result (see @Compendium[world.up-the-creek.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Cards}) on the way to the encounter, and that Shock is still in effect when the encounter starts.</p>\n<h3>The Deep Mist</h3>\n<p>The group only has four rounds to complete the Dramatic Skill Resolution thanks to getting lost. Award each Storm Knight 2 Possibilities for the extra trouble.</p>"}
