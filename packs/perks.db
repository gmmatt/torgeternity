Perhaps none are more powerful or varied than their mastery of arcane chemical concoctions.Alchemy allows a character to create and charge magical potions with a variety of effects. They may drink them, give them to allies, apply them as unguents to surfaces, or even throw them like grenades.Choose any three of the potions below. Alchemists channel magical energy, so they may have no more than three potions in existence at any one time. If more are created, they have no magical <q>spark</q> and simply fail to work. The player must record which potions are currently prepared and mark them off as they are used.Creating new potions requires 30 minutes + 10 minutes per concoction, and a small portable kit of assorted chemicals, reagents, and equipment.<strong>Using Potions:</strong> Drinking a potion, elixir, or similar concoction is a simple action. Drinking up to three potions is a standard action.Some potions are used in glass grenades. These use the <em>missile weapons</em> skill and have a Range of 5/10/15, and detonate on impact as long as they hit some sort of solid surface.<strong>Extra Potions:</strong> This Perk may be taken more than once. Each time after the first the Alchemist learns a new potion and may have one more potion in existence at once.<ul><li><strong>Demon’s Breath:</strong> Alchemists discovered these dreadful draughts by accident, but were eventually able to turn them into fearsome weapons. The potion is thrown inside a glass container. On impact, everything in a Small Blast Radius is engulfed in yellow-green fire that causes 16 fire damage (see <strong>Fire</strong> on page 136)</li><li><strong>Elixir of Enhancement:</strong> Choose an attribute each time this choice is selected. When imbibed, the potion increases that attribute by +2 for one minute. An <em>elixir of Dexterity</em>, for example, increases <em>Dexterity</em> by two points for one minute. When the elixir wears off, the character suffers a −2 penalty to the affected attribute for one hour</li><li><strong>Elixir of Life:</strong> Drinking this potent concoction immediately removes all <img class='icon' src='/static/icons/shock.webp' alt='Shock' title='Shock'></li><li><strong>Iron Sheen:</strong> While priests’ blessings are the preferred method of allowing Victorian soldiers to affect the ethereal horrors of their world, alchemists have developed an oil of their own as well. As an action, an application can coat a sword, three knives, arrows, or bolts, a single cannonball, or up to six bullets. The weapons or projectiles can then harm creatures with the Ethereal Special Ability for the duration of the scene. The magical effects wear off quickly, so items may not be <q>sheened</q> and stored</li><li><strong>Thunder Brew:</strong> This explosive brew is placed inside a glass container and used as a grenade. It detonates on impact, potentially concussing anyone in a Medium Blast. Those affected must make a standard <em>Strength</em> test.

Crafted for close encounters, the short-barrel carbine design of the slayer’s gun allows it to be used in melee like a pistol.Because the bullets are necessarily large and require exacting specifications, monster hunters who make use of them have standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them—the rounds don’t work in any other kind of weapon.<ul><li><strong>Slayer’s Gun:</strong> Range 50/100/200, damage 14, Shots 6</li></ul>Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six special bullets as long as they have access to their gear (which always contains a small bullet-making kit).
