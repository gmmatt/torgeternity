<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The Race are humans native to Tharkold. They have struggled in servitude to the technodemons who have ruled there for centuries. The resistance has been around in various forms since the Race was subjugated, but the power and reach of the technodemons limited its accomplishments to mere survival&mdash;until now. Tharkold&rsquo;s ill-fated attack on Core Earth created an opportunity, and now the beleaguered members of the resistance are seizing the moment and making the most of it.</p>\n<h3>Tactics</h3>\n<p>Your Thav-9 is a deadly submachinegun, and its volume of fire makes up for your relative inexperience with it. Psychic power is where you shine. <em>Energize </em>is draining, but the boost to your <em>Dexterity </em>enhances all your attacks and defenses, and the boost to <em>Strength </em>increases your Toughness and melee damage. The Max Dex on your armor is high enough to allow you the full benefit of both bonuses. <em>Telekinesis </em>adds versatility, and lets you use your pain gauntlet to grapple and attack at range&mdash;and use kinesis to attack and use your <em>Mind </em>instead of <em>Strength </em>for damage.</p>\n<p>Your secret weapon is your leadership potential. Bolster can eliminate harmful effects from a Drama card (such as Confused, Fatigue or even a Surge) and swing the tide of battle.</p>\n<h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>\n<p>A lifetime of servitude came to an end when you stood up for a fellow slave and said, &ldquo;No!&ldquo; to the technodemons. That moment also unlocked the psionic powers that enabled you both to survive! Alternatively, the moment may have come once you arrived on Core Earth, when the lower Tech Axiom disabled your slave collar and you incited a small rebellion.</p>\n<h3>Quote</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Cast off your shackles and fight! Fight with your thoughts, with your guns, or with your bare hands if you have to.&ldquo;</p>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Members of the resistance wear armor cobbled together from anything they can find. Resources are scarce in Tharkold, and the situation isn&rsquo;t much better on Earth. What your outfit lacks in looks it makes up for in practical protection. You have a forceful bearing and intense passion that makes people take you seriously.</p>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p>The ultimate goal of the resistance is freedom for the Race, and all people, now and forever. The High Lords are all obstacles to that goal.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Aren, Caron, Dalia, Ibis, Kellan, Leya, Mani, Sabra, Theta, Zoya</p>\n<h3>Advancement Track (Optional)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Psionic (strangle)</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Natural Leader</li>\n<li>(1 XP) persuasion +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) fire combat +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) fire combat +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) kinesis +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) kinesis +5</li>\n<li>(3 XP) reality +3</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Resistance_Fighter.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Resistance Fighter","displayName":30,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Resistance_Fighter.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"6ThunRV3sj9ZSMQW","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"mkDfDTkeExfM9yZj","name":"Bolster","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Leadership","cosm":"(None)","prerequisites":"Charisma 8+, at least one add in reality","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>A true leader can empower his allies with a stern gaze, a short speech, or some other act that steels their resolve against adverse circumstances.</p><p>Characters with this Perk can spend a <img class='icon-sm' src='/static/icons/possibility.webp' alt='Possibility' title='Possibility'> to counter any Disadvantage affecting his party on the current Drama card’s Conflict Line.

round":"<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>You are a Victorian, and your world, Gaea, is caught in the grip of the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s horrors. You weren&rsquo;t content to be ruled by terror, and so you fought back. Against all odds you survived, and the various tricks, gadgets, and special weapons you&rsquo;ve acquired over years of battling evil have evened the odds considerably.</p>\n<p>When the Gaunt Man gathered his dark forces to travel through the maelstrom bridges and unleash their fury upon Core Earth, you followed to stalk them, just as you&rsquo;ve always done.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>The special shells in your Slayer&rsquo;s Gun gives you power and flexibility against specific foes, even outside of Orrorsh. Whenever you can, investigate what types of foes are likely to appear and prepare a custom load of shells to deal with them. Holy Water shells work well against gospog, a common enemy employed by all the High Lords. Even once all your specialized shells are used, your standard ammunition still packs a punch.</p>\n<p>You are highly resistant to fear and intimidation, but extremely vulnerable to taunt interactions. Victorians are notoriously haughty and intolerant of insults!</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Your crisis came long ago on Gaea. Maybe it was a werewolf, or perhaps it was a vampire. Whatever it was, it was a product of the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s evil. Tracking it back to its lair was foolhardy, but your attempt triggered a change in you. As a Storm Knight you finally had the power to fight back.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to stop fearing a thing once you have the power to destroy it.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Battling monsters is a dangerous profession, and you bear numerous scars attesting to that fact. Only some of those scars are visible. Victorians prefer modest dress, even in excruciating heat, and you&rsquo;re no exception. Your distinctive coat made of strange leather and the ornately decorated, oversized Slayer&rsquo;s Gun you carry are both giveaways to your profession.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The destruction of evil is an imperative. If left to fester, monsters only become more vile and powerful. The High Lords, for all their tricks and facades, are just more monsters for you to stalk and terminate.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ashton, Aubrey, Eli, Harper, Marion, Prester, Tanner, Thomas, Winter</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Sniper</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Bulletsmith (Explosive Shells)</li>\n<li>(1 XP) trick +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) maneuver +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) intimidation +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) melee weapons +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) fire combat +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) fire combat +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Monster_Hunter.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Monster Hunter","displayName":30,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Monster_Hunter.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8KlJAaxeijOcrJKN","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"9Kmq8C81nIIjwSdi","name":"Bulletsmith","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Occult","cosm":"Orrorsh","prerequisites":"At least 2 adds in science","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>Adventurers of Orrorsh long ago learned lead bullets and steel blades were no match for the horrors of their realm.

He receives his weapon and the knowledge to make basic metal slugs (damage 14) and any three of the specialized rounds below. Crafted for close encounters, the short-barrel carbine design of the slayer&rsquo;s gun allows it to be used in melee like a pistol.</p>\n<p>Because the bullets are necessarily large and require exacting specifications, monster hunters who make use of them have standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them&mdash;the rounds don&rsquo;t work in any other kind of weapon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slayer&rsquo;s Gun:</strong> Range 50/100/200, damage 14, Shots 6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six special bullets as long as they have access to their gear (which always contains a small bullet-making kit). If more rounds are created, they lose the magical essence the Bulletsmith inherently provides and act as regular slugs (damage 14). Replacement rounds may be created between scenes, or during downtime if the Game Master feels it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>\n<p>Slayer&rsquo;s guns are designed to rotate quickly and so can fire any one of their preloaded six chambers (specified before use).

A previously unknown side-effect of these rounds is that they can cause glitches in high-tech <em>electronic</em> equipment. Robots and machines take the extra damage, and sensitive equipment shorts out and is inoperable for three rounds</li>\n<li><strong>Explosive Shell:</strong> The most dangerous of the Bullet Smith&rsquo;s shells causes damage 15 in a Small Blast Radius</li>\n<li><strong>Giant Killer Shell:</strong> The Victorians developed these heavy shells to take down the Gaunt Man&rsquo;s biggest horrors. They cause +5 damage against Large or greater creatures</li>\n<li><strong>Holy Water Shell:</strong> +2 damage versus any supernaturally evil creature, including gospog, vampires, and undead</li>\n<li><strong>Phantom Shell:</strong> These rounds are made from various reagents such as cold iron, salt, and holy water that allows them to affect ethereal creatures normally</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Shell:</strong> Creatures with the Lycanthrope Special Ability take +4 damage from silver shells</li>\n<li><strong>Sun Shell:</strong> These rounds contain something the alchemists call <q>liquid sunlight.</q> They explode with ultraviolet light in a Medium Blast, causing any creatures <q>hit</q> by them to be Very Vulnerable if they have a sensitivity to light or sunlight.

Afterwards, it may be taken multiple times, but only after completing the event described in the individual awards.

The Delphi Council understands the mystical nature of these awards, however, and assists the Victorians in delivering them when possible.

This award is granted to anyone who takes part in the killing of a ravagon, his fiercest lieutenants.

The character adds +1 BD&nbsp;to all damage totals against all Large or greater-sized creatures (not vehicles or constructs) when Attack is an Approved Action</li>\n<li><strong>Order of Cynthia Bartholomew:</strong> Awarded for helping the injured or poor under great threat or for an extended period. <q>Ms. Bart,</q> as the poor called her, was a Victorian humanitarian who always helped the poor and downtrodden. Once per act, the recipient can touch an ally to remove all . This is a simple action</li>\n<li><strong>Victoria Gloriana:</strong> Awarded after personally playing a Glory card. This prestigious award is only granted to the country&rsquo;s greatest heroes. The medal grants a +1 bonus to any one attribute and its linked skills, chosen when the medal is awarded. Note that if the medal is worn and the attribute or linked skill is used, it does cause a Contradiction</li>\n<li><strong>Possibility Wars Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any Storm Knight who participates in a Glory event. The medal is awarded per cosm, and may be used once per act to restore 1 BD of shock. This does not require an action and may be used at any time</li>\n<li><strong>Sole Survivor Medal:</strong> Awarded to the one person to return from an otherwise doomed expedition. The Sole Survivor medal cancels the effects of The Law of Perseverance and its recipient may Soak damage normally in Orrorsh.</li>\n<li><strong>India Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any Storm Knight who recovers an Eternity Shard inside Orrorsh.

This award is a mixed blessing, as its presence also alerts Victorians that the wearer is cursed, which may lead to trust issues.

You may use an unarmed attack even while both pistols are equipped; you just kick or strike with your elbows.</p>\n<h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>\n<p>Something big was going down, and some corporate type named &ldquo;Kanawa&ldquo; was at the center of it. You were threatened with suspension and asked to let it go by your superiors. Someone even tried to kill you. You stayed on the case, even after the Contagion began, and your stubborn pursuit triggered a subtle transformation. Alternatively, the change may have come when you defended a group of supposedly infected refugees from a murderous Kanawa Corporation &ldquo;Containment Team.&ldquo;</p>\n<h3>Quote</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s jiangshi, criminals, or invaders from another reality, one bullet can still make a difference.&ldquo;</p>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Others may scoff at your leather jacket, but it&rsquo;s truly a timeless fashion accessory. Plus it hides your two shoulder holsters very well. Your badge is useful in Hong Kong where you have jurisdiction, but it may work elsewhere in Pan-Pacifica so long as people don&rsquo;t look at it too closely! You are intense, and don&rsquo;t tolerate disrespect toward you or your badge.</p>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p>The Kanawa Corporation is hiding something, a connection to the other Possibility Raiders or the Contagion. Whatever is going on, it could shake all of Pan-Pacifica. Good or bad, your job is to discover the truth.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Bao, Curry, Dee, Eagle, Jin, Li, Ling, Shooter, Whiskey, Zhang</p>\n<h3>Advancement Track (Optional)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Double Tap</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Ki Strike</li>\n<li>(1 XP) persuasion +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) reality +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) dodge +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) unarmed combat +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) fire combat +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) fire combat +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Hardboiled_Detective.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Hardboiled Detective","displayName":30,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Hardboiled_Detective.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8YH1e6xGG3IHb1Mm","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nHyY0U6fVQiVDVyn","name":"Block Strike","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Ki Powers","cosm":"(None)","prerequisites":"Spirit 8+, at least three adds in unarmed combat","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>When a foe misses the martial artist with a melee attack, she may take one shock to immediately make a melee attack of her own against that opponent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Found in <strong>Core Rules</strong></p>"},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.te001-core-rulebook.Items.6yvgujLe6KwpQj8J"}},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/icons/perk.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"fDmgFKD2UiNiuObq","name":"Brawler","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Prowess","cosm":"(None)","prerequisites":"At least two adds in unarmed combat","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>The fighter hits hard thanks to anything from dirty tricks and a good uppercut to training in karate, jujitsu, tae kwon do, or similar hand-tohand fighting styles.

ou were brilliant, and perhaps a bit odd, even before the Possibility Wars. After you transformed to fit the pulpy reality of the Nile Empire anything became possible. Immutable laws of physics are now mere guidelines. You push this new freedom to its limits, inventing wondrous electronic devices and then using them against the Possibility Raiders.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your Electro-Ray is effective, but it can run out of charges if used on too many targets too quickly. Your trick interaction is especially devastating. Many opponents are weak against trick, and a &ldquo;Player&rsquo;s Call&ldquo; result might eliminate even stronger foes when the circumstances support it.</p>\n<p>While your Force Field is operational you can use its charges to Soak Wounds. It can block two Shock even if there&rsquo;s no Wound, but it&rsquo;s better to save those charges. Once the Force Field is depleted, or if an untimely disconnection disables it, you are extremely susceptible to damage. If possible, hang on to a Destiny card like Willpower or Action to help reconnect if you get into a tight spot.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Faced with an onslaught of invaders in Cairo you turned to science for a way to fight back, and in a moment of indescribable inspiration (and crisis) you reassembled a phone, a lava lamp, and a blow dryer into a deadly energy projector. Alternatively, you may have transformed while destroying some of your older inventions and plans before they could fall into the hands of Mobius and his hordes.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Whoa, who could have predicted a sudden polarity inversion would cause an explosion like that. I mean, other than me. Because I totally called that.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Your vulcanized rubber lab coat is for work, but underneath that you&rsquo;re always ready for a good party.

Runners are humans from Earth who have a strong, intuitive grasp of reality. Not just the reality of Core Earth, but the invading cosms as well. Such individuals are supremely adaptable, traveling through the invading realms with relative ease and picking up tools and concepts that cause contradictions with most others. This phenomenon seems unique to Core Earth.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You are a jack-of-all-trades: reasonably proficient with most weapons but a master of none. Then again, any weapon or item you find in any reality is fair game. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try out and use powerful tools from other realities, even if they might cause Contradictions. Disconnections still happen, but not as often and it&rsquo;s easy for you to reconnect, even in a Pure Zone.</p>\n<p>Use any Approved interaction (trick is strongest) to Stymie opponents or make them Vulnerable. Success gains you a Destiny card and helps out the team&mdash;or enhances your own chances for a successful followup attack. Your high reality skill lets you Soak damage very reliably, so you&rsquo;re much tougher than you look.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Before the invasion, every day was pretty routine. Then the world was shattered and a deadly choice presented itself: run in terror like everyone else or stop a monster from devouring some innocent. Somehow, blind luck prevailed, the victim was saved, and a Storm Knight was born.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry guys, I got this!&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Lean and agile, your trademark look is a hodgepodge of whatever is effective. Denim, leather, and a mischievous grin are constants. Everything else from advanced gadgets to magical totems get haphazardly piled on during journeys to different realms.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>On the surface it seems like you are just fooling around, and perhaps not taking these dangerous situations seriously enough. Under that exterior, however, you are deeply concerned for the individuals caught in the middle of the Possibility Wars. Saving these people from immediate danger and keeping their spirits up is your real priority&mdash;having fun while you do it is just a bonus.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Adison, Aidan, Cody, Daryl, Jamie, Lee, Leslie, Regan, Sean, Terry</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Adaptable</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Story Teller</li>\n<li>(1 XP) streetwise +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) trick +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) dodge +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) trick +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) reality +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) reality +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Realm_Runner.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Realm Runner","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Realm_Runner.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"BpClx5rBCesWUzIN","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"kDR688PEiU9j0oUd","name":"Prodigy","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Reality","cosm":"Core Earth","prerequisites":"","timestaken":null,"description":"The character is filled with Possibility Energy.

und":"<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The Electric Samurai are a group of modern-day warriors who follow the ancient code of Bushido, but using ultra-modern weapons and armor. The origins&nbsp;of the movement are muddled, a strange meeting of punk youth culture and the staid descendants of the the original samurai. Membership is by invitation only, and invitations are only extended to those who prove themselves worthy both in and out of battle.</p>\n<p>Stormers and other foes may wear the same armor or wield similar weapons, but they are not true samurai. It is the duty of the chosen to challenge such pretenders.</p>\n<h3>Tactics</h3>\n<p>Your primary weapon is your electric katana, which deals amazing damage and pierces armor. There’s no dishonor in being practical, so your SC Kyogo 144 SMG is useful for evening the odds against large numbers of weaker opponents. Take advantage of the submachinegun’s huge ammunition clip and use Long Bursts often. Most of your interactions are strong, try to use them when they’re Approved Actions—except for taunt. Petty insults are frivolous and distasteful.</p>\n<h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>\n<p>When the Contagion first appeared you worked as a bio-engineer, with a specialty in genetic research. Before anyone understood what was happening a jiangshi broke containment and began slaughtering your co-workers. Perhaps it was the years of Kendo lessons that helped you fight off the creature. Or maybe it was the calm and methodical way you rescued the patients and personnel nearby. Either way, it triggered a change in you, and also drew the attention of the Electric Samurai movement.</p>\n<h3>Quote</h3>\n<p>“I wouldn’t soil my blade on a foe such as you.“</p>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The ion gusoku and electric katana are the unmistakable trademarks of the Electric Samurai. Rigid control and impeccable manners are ideals you strive for, but have never quite attained.</p>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p>The eight virtues of Bushido compel you to battle the Possibility Raiders and the Contagion—and to protect the innocent people threatened by both. Follow the code. Be righteous, heroic, compassionate, polite, honest, honorable, loyal, and disciplined— even when it’s inconvenient.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Akimi, Haruka, Izumi, Jun, Kazumi, Maru, Riku, Shigeri, Tomo</p>\n<h3>Advancement Track (Optional)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Unflinching</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Ion Gusoku (Lightning Sheath)</li>\n<li>(1 XP) missile weapons +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) reality +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) dodge +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) land vehicles +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) melee weapons +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) melee weapons +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Electric_Samurai.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Electric Samurai","displayName":30,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Electric_Samurai.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"QVpKuacd4LKfpJOy","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"XNNnqI7Q5kO7Z7hb","name":"Ion Gusoku","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Electric Samurai","cosm":"(None)","prerequisites":"Spirit 8+, at least two adds in melee weapons","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>The distinctive armor of the Electric Samurai is the Ion Gusoku.

ns are Ayslish hunters and guardians who haunt the woods like ghosts, striking at enemies of the elves with stealth and guile. The longbow and green cloak are signatures of the wardens, as are the white wolves many keep as companions.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You’re a ranged combatant through and through. The longsword is available in a pinch, but it’s usually better to hang back and focus on your bow. Drawing an arrow is a simple action, so you can target two or three opponents with a single attack.</p>\n<p>One tactic wardens find useful is to keep your wolf out of direct combat and have it intimidate instead. This can make the foe Vulnerable to a follow-up attack with your bow.</p>\n<p>If opponents manage to engage your furry friend, use Active Defense to protect it or soak damage using your own Possibilities.</p>\n<p>Watch out for Zones with a low Magic Axiom like Core Earth, the Living Land, and Pan-Pacifica, since elves suffer three Shock when Fatigue appears.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Though the Wardens protect the forests of Aysle from dark forces, very few become Storm Knights. Your crisis likely came after following Lady Ardinay on her foolish quest to Earth. Facing the old foe in such a different place stirred something that defending the woods did not. It’s also possible you abandoned duty to save a dwarf or human, and in that selfless moment transformed.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>“In the woods, all creatures are either hunters or prey. I assure you I am not prey.“</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Wood elves are known for being quiet and shy, especially compared to their mystical cousins. Wardens wear mostly supple leather or densely woven cloth, just so long as it moves silently. Green is a favored color, even when outside the woods.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The Elven Warden is privy to a dark secret kept by the elite among the High Elves, and has come to Core Earth out of a misplaced sense of guilt. Perhaps if the High Lords are defeated all the peoples of Aysle may finally know peace.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Amavae, Cimbar, Feyurit, Lief, Namys of Glaed, Nuvia, Rose, Tierra, Waldir</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Elven Archer</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Sniper</li>\n<li>(1 XP) lockpicking +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) melee weapons +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) dodge +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) stealth +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) missile weapons +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) missile weapons +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"elf"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Elven_Warden.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Elven Warden","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Elven_Warden.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"cdSvyJHbG0GbFzkh","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"q33jbisDvFLOCyfH","name":"Warden","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Elf","cosm":"Aysle","prerequisites":"Elf","timestaken":null,"description":"<p>Elven wardens roamed the wilderness of Aysle before Uthorion&rsquo;s Rage, always alert for threats to the good folk.

 reptilian inhabitants of Takta Ker are fierce and savage warriors. The environment is brutal, filled with carnivorous plants, hostile creatures, and giant carnivores. The edeinos see no contradiction in bringing death to their foes in the name of Lanala, the goddess of life. Death begets life. Decay seeds the soil which brings forth new growth. Optants are priests who embody Lanala&rsquo;s way, known as &ldquo;Keta Kalles.&ldquo;</p>\n<p>Most optants remain loyal to Baruk Kaah, but some believe the High Lord has actually abandoned Keta Kalles, and Lanala&rsquo;s faithful must now rise against him.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your strong arm and sharp &ldquo;hrockt shoot&ldquo; spear are enough to dispatch most foes. The strike miracle may enhance your spear when faced with a particularly tenacious foe. Intimidation interactions are also useful for softening up opposition. Your defenses are mediocre (taunts and tricks are your particular vulnerabilities), but with a high reality you can Soak most damage.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Lanala commanded the edeinos to bring life to dead places in other worlds&mdash;or so Baruk Kaah said. In practice though, the sensations of war felt wrong to you, an affront to Lanala rather than an exultation of her. The feeling proved true when turning against Kaah triggered your transcendence.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;I almost envy the pain you are about to experience.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>It may seem odd for a priest of life to wear a dinosaur skull and many bones, but death and decay are just another part of life. These aren&rsquo;t dead things&mdash; things of stone and metal that were never touched by Lanala&mdash;they were once alive. Like most edeinos you are informal, lacking the manners and social boundaries humans take for granted.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The path to Lanala is through the experience of sensation&mdash;pain, pleasure, and rare feelings beyond both. Baruk Kaah and the High Lords are threats to Lanala, but the most important thing is to feel.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Bloodclaw, Dathil, Longjaw, Moonwalker, Razortooth, Riscaran, Stormtail, Wildeye</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Stone Skin</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Protected</li>\n<li>(1 XP) tracking +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) dodge +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) stealth +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) melee weapons +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) faith +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) faith +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"edeinos"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Edeinos_Optant.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Edeinos Optant","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Edeinos_Optant.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"hcdhRCs56U5JrAl4","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"5my70YmZnnaeEIRG","name":"Outsider","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Racial","cosm":"Living Land","prerequisites":"","timestaken":null,"description":"<p>Edeinos are outsiders to everyone but other edeinos.

If forced into melee combat, try grappling to restrain opponents rather than depending on straight damage.</p>\n<p>Negation is your secret weapon. Blocking a Stormer&rsquo;s ability to boost attacks is nothing to scoff at, and can quickly turn the momentum of any battle. Use intimidation to soften up your foes. Stymie subtracts from their total and Vulnerable adds to yours. Since Negation requires a contest of reality you can take advantage of both!</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>Dozens of incidents may have pushed you from hero to Storm Knight. It might have been the renegade Stormer using his powers to build a new drug cartel. Or it could have been the time you pinned and cuffed a rampaging raptor&mdash;people are still talking about that one.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Put the weird glowing thing down on the ground and place your hands on your head.&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to still wear the uniform, even out of jurisdiction or in places that have been transformed. It projects normalcy and authority, and the bulletproof vest doesn&rsquo;t hurt either. Not everyone likes or respects the police, but just seeing the blue and the badge still snaps most people back to reality. Brusque manners and an intense gaze reinforce that sense of strength.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>The Unstoppable Cop just wants to get things back to normal. Reality has laws too, and these invaders are breaking them. Cut through the nonsense, stop the bad guys, and protect the poor innocents caught in the middle.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Alta, Carmen, Cristian, Dani, Gabriel, Jaide, Lani, Marvel, Paz, Rio, Sal</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Strong-Willed</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Hard to Kill</li>\n<li>(1 XP) lockpicking +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) streetwise +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) fire combat +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) reality +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) fire combat +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) fire combat +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":null,"fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Unstoppable_Cop.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Unstoppable Cop","displayName":0,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Unstoppable_Cop.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"non4XwpfJLE9GiST","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Bh5BKWwn5ZCR10rX","name":"Negation","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Reality","cosm":"Core Earth","prerequisites":"None","timestaken":1,"description":"<p>When an enemy attempts to spend a Possibility for an attribute or skill test, the Storm Knight may spend her own Possibility to instantly negate it.

s transformed to the reality of the Living Land don&rsquo;t become Neanderthals as some rumors claim. They remain completely human, but are now perfectly adapted to the harsh physical environment and a low Social Axiom that makes certain thoughts contradictory. Confusing memories of their pretransformation life remain, but most just don&rsquo;t make sense anymore.</p>\n<p>These humans also hear the voice of Lanala and worship her the same way the edeinos do. Worshipers are known as &ldquo;jakkats,&ldquo; followers of the ways of Keta Kalles. Jakkats worship by savoring every sensation life has to offer.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>You usually just get close and stab or bludgeon your foes until they stop moving. You can throw your spear in the rare case where you don&rsquo;t wish to get too close to an opponent. All-Out Attack is usually a good option, either to trigger the Relentless Perk or to take advantage of the Law of Savagery when it applies. Maneuver is your interaction of choice, although intimidation works well in a pinch.</p>\n<p>The Sabre-Tooth Cat companion isn&rsquo;t a full-sized tiger, but its claws are deadly.

After transforming, some spark of your independence remained. When the weak and soft people from your old life were attacked, you acted and became something more.

You changed too, and now you&rsquo;re quick, clever, and bold enough to find the relics hidden within such sites.</p>\n<p>The rewards of such expeditions are worth the risk. Some dark places hide information about the Possibility Raiders or the monsters who serve them. Others contain treasures, and the most valuable are artifacts called Eternity Shards&mdash;desperately sought by both the Delphi Council and the High Lords.</p>\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n<p>Your high <em>Dexterity </em>and <em>dodge </em>allow you to take huge risks and usually escape unscathed. Your defenses in melee aren&rsquo;t as good, so keep your distance whenever possible. Your machete is a weapon of last resort, but is handy when drawn along with a pistol to gain your melee weapons defense against nearby foes. The other option is blazing away with two pistols at a time, which gives a +2 bonus to hit!</p>\n<p>Use <em>maneuver </em>to set up an opponent, especially if it&rsquo;s an Approved Action.</p>\n<h2>Moment of Crisis</h2>\n<p>When the Night of Screams fell you pitched in to help when the first wave of devastation hit. As the monsters came, everyone else died. The moment may have come when you fought back against the creatures and defeated one by maneuvering it into a deadly trap. Or it may have come from carrying a wounded victim to safety.</p>\n<h2>Quote</h2>\n<p>&ldquo;It belongs in a museum! Well, perhaps not, but there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m letting you have it!&ldquo;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>You are fashionable, and prefer bright colors and an eclectic mixture of the modern efficiency and traditional style. You are daring, earnest, and levelheaded. You secretly enjoy irritating Victorians.</p>\n<h2>Agenda</h2>\n<p>Eternity Shards are important artifacts. Not just culturally, but for the clues they offer about how reality functions and the power they contain. Whatever they are, you need to find them, and keep them out of the hands of the High Lords.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anishaa, Bhaanu, Dara, Ganjan, Kantha, Maalya, Navya, Padma, Rahel</p>\n<h2>Advancement Track (Optional)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>(5 XP) Situational Awareness</li>\n<li>(7 XP) Endurance</li>\n<li>(1 XP) faith +1</li>\n<li>(2 XP) scholar +2</li>\n<li>(3 XP) fire combat +3</li>\n<li>(3 XP) reality +3</li>\n<li>(4 XP) dodge +4</li>\n<li>(5 XP) dodge +5</li>\n</ul>","race":"human"},"editstate":"inline","fatigue":"1"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Relic_Raider.Avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Relic Raider","displayName":30,"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/characters/Relic_Raider.Token.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"tbqGzMeQeCA3n1Mt","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":30,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"shock"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hGMOwQsVX9hXhB1B","name":"Indomitable","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Prowess","cosm":"Universal","prerequisites":"","timestaken":"1","description":"<p>When the character attempts an Active Defense the test is Favored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Found in <strong>Core Rules</strong></p>"},"sort":100000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.te001-core-rulebook.Items.perk-indomitable"}},"img":"systems/torgeternity/images/icons/perk.webp","effects":[]},{"_id":"yJtCrW7pRJJ1iIqx","name":"Tenacious","type":"perk","data":{"category":"Reality","cosm":"Core Earth","prerequisites":"Spirit 8+","timestaken":"1","description":"<p>Nothing seems to keep the hero down for long.

Your best plan is usually to get into the middle of the bad guys and start swinging! Your CyberArm adds even more <em>Strength </em>to the attack. Your interactions aren&rsquo;t very strong compared to your hammer, but are worth a try when they are Approved Actions. If your opponents remain out of reach, try to find discarded firearms or use intimidation on them.</p>\n<h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>\n<p>After the Battle of Moscow, desertion was your only option. The Blasted Land called to you, offering you a clean death far away from politics and betrayal. Instead you found people there, desperate ones beset by the abominations the fallout created.
