## v. 12.2.0

- Ammunition is now handled. The value of a weapon with ammo is now reduced according to the amount of bullets a shot takes (i.e. burst shots). A weapon can now be equipped with a general gear item like an _Ammo Belt_ that will be consumed if you click the reload button on the weapon. [#36](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/36). Please be aware that the values in the ammunition item don't have any effects _yet_, as this is an [issue](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/428) for later.
  - On this cause we've thrown the BD button on each item out. It was a relic from the old days that is no longer needed because of the handling by chat cards.
- A secondary axiom is now selectable on most items [#46](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/46)
- Weapons do now have a minimum strength value, that is computed alongside minStr of armor items. [#116](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/116)

- By clicking on the "Done" button as a player during a combat in the combat tracker, active effects are now handled and taken off automaticaly. Threats can be treated in the same way if you're ticking the checkmark in the combat tracker as the gm!
- New macro for showing the next 1-3 cards per chat whisper to player(s)
- New macro for getting back the previous drama card (in case if the player plays a "Seize initiative" card when you've picked already a new drama card)
- New macro to give a player the **last** played card back.
- A new buff macro that will easily choose an effect, that will be applied to your character for a specific amount of rounds.
  (All of the above concerned issue [#351](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/351))
- Bug quishing and style issues:
  - Fixed the archetypes' missile weapon category
  - used async enrichment for description fields [#429](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/429)
  - Moved the hover pooled card in combat tracker out to the left edge that might give a better view on the combat tracker itself [[#131](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/131)]
  - Relocated where minStr and maxDex are stored to keep the partysheet clean [#433](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/433)
  - Clicking the dice images in a chatcard no longer hides them [#433](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/334)

- A new option has been added to determine whether the details of the chat cards should be automatically expanded or not. [#420](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/420)
- Bug squishing and style issues:
  - In fatigue macro, there was some wierd thing going on with the Math.max method, so changed this. [#425](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/425)
  - For powers, the result of BDs were concated instead of added. Happend that test.damage was a string in this case. [#426](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/426)

## v. 12.1.1

- Hotfix for custom skills. These should work again. In their own special treatment ;)

## v. 12.1.0

- v12 compatibility is here! From now on, the system follows the foundry version in it's _major_ part of the version number.
- Broken links are no longer ugly placeholders, but a glowing effect on hovering remains to signal that there should be something there [#382](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/382)
- It is now possible to roll BDs and add damage in advance, using the dialog window [#123](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/123). From this work followed:
  - Reorganized the roll dialog, something prettier
  - Chatcards now show the sum of damage from BDs in the details (if applicable)
- Solved bugs and style issues:
  - BDs on powers weren't shown on a chat card [#406](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/406)
  - More rolls are asynchronous (as it should've been since a long time and needed for V12)
  - Upstyling of the combat tracker

## v. 3.8.1

- Migration-correction
- Fixed minDex maxStr check by SKs/ Threats

## v. 3.8.0

- Better migrations for active defense, that were active in existing worlds
- Style-rearrangement on perk item, prerequisites are now on a more comfortable place [#158](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/158)
- 'Find' is now available as DN for stealthy tests [#387](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/387)
- Perks now have the "Ground Sloth" & "Special / Homebrew" categories for your own needs, and adding a new box for general contradictions that will be displayed in the chat cards [#389](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/389)
- Chat cards do have now enriched HTML, as well as item descriptions in character's gear [#386](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/pull/386)
- Stymied & vulnerable effects do now have a duration.
- Chatcards now will offer backlashes and headaches in case of a failed power test. [#392](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/392)
- On Roll-dialogues, if a bonus number is entered into the previous roll field, the 'Input existing' radio button will now be automatically checked to support gameflow. [#384](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/384)
- By RAW, the DN on a multi target attack is the highest DN. This is now implemented- as well as an option to toggle that off for houserule purposses (as it was implemented until now).
- Processing now attributes no longer with `system.attributes.[attribute]`, but with `system.attributes.[attribute].base` (please **never** use this for change-purposses) and `system.attributes.[attribute].value` (this is the one you want to use). This ensures a safer handling with attribute scores that should not be affecting the ground value of the attribute. Therefore, the attributes now can only be altered by clicking the "Edit" button in the attribute fields. In case you're confused: The values of the fields are changing to their base value, not their current, modified value (if applicable).
- Bug- and stylefixes:
  - Style-Fix for vehicle addon item [#383](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/383)
  - Style-fix on general Chat-Cards holding item informations [#208](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/208)
  - Corrections on DataModels
  - The equipped item now shows colour again
  - Size of characters are fixed
  - Recovered TinyMCE CSS File that got lost on the way
  - Not really a fix, but updated all item editor fields to ProseMirror engine, because TinyMCE won't work anymore correctly and isn't supported anymore
  - Rerolls are now asynchronous, as synchronous rolls are decapricated in V12

- After an interaction-attack, it will now be possible to apply stymied / vulnerable directly by the chat card. Please click the button twice if the status is "very..."

## v. 3.3.0

- If a Storm Knight is deleted, the appropriate hand will be deleted as well.
- The combat tracker now behaves like it should for TE: All players now have the "Done" button displayed. If a player
  clicks it, the GM's combat tracker will be updated with a checked checkmark at the apropriate character. However, to
  end the round is totally up to the GM.
- New possibilities by cosm window! Click on "Possibilities" on your character sheet, a new window will open to help
  keeping you track of cosm-specific possibilities. Players can hit the key "P", as this bound for opening this window
  as well. If the apropriate premium module is active, clicking the title of the cosm-possibility will open the journal
  entry for quick rule reference. **PLEASE NOTE:** This won't have any impact on the system's behaviour, it's just for
  your convenience for accounting purposses.

  - A possibility now is removed on a soak roll
  - If you are about to spend your last possibility, you're asked if you're really sure about that. At last, you could
    need it otherwise...

  - However, if a GM wants to grand you a possibility (there are moments, when heroes are needed!), the GM can click on
    "Possibility" on your chat card to produce a possibility roll
- The law of action!
  - If on a scene are the cosms "None", "Other" or "Nile Empire" set, the mechanics for the law of action are principle
    possible to trigger. This means that you can click on "Possibility" twice, and the best result is chosen. We decided
    to take the "None" and "Other" cosm choice to be placed in this mechanics as well for GMs who are more playing a
    theatre of mind or don't want to configure cosms on their scenes.
- CusomSkills are now "favorable".

## v. 0.92.1

Various bug fixes and some additional UI enhancements. Added data structure to some items and reorganized some of the
item windows to accommodate additional data structure. Added ability to track ammo by treating ammo as a resource
(current/max). NOTE: sorry, everyone, but you are going to lose the data in your ammo field in existing weapons sheets.
You'll need to re-input the max ammo for any existing items. We will try to avoid doing this much, if any, in the
future.

Updated appearance of journal entry windows.

Known issue: some sheets that were created with a VERY early version of the system may display the attributes window
improperly on the Storm Knight sheet. We haven't tried to fix this because we assume there aren't many sheets like that
floating around out there. But if it is an issue for you, let us know. We can fix it.

## v. 0.92.0

Major user interface update! We have completely revamped all of the sheets (thanks much to @rwanoux for all his hard
work to get this done!).

NOTES FOR v. 0.91.0 We have added support for active effects! These effects are available for each Storm Knight and for
any items attached to Storm Knights. Active effects allow you to modify the base statistics for Storm Knights. They are
most useful for adding armor and defenses, but can also be used to modify skill values, attributes, and other related
statistics. To apply an active effect from an item (such as a piece of armor), create or edit the armor from the items
tab and add a passive effect that mirrors the abilities of the item. Then, drag and drop it onto the chracter sheet
(note that Foundry does not currently support editing active effects within items once they are attached to a character,
but you can still edit the effect on the character's "Effects" tab). For a list of Storm Knight statistics that can be
modified, see https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/wiki/Storm-Knight-Data-Elements.
