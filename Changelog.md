## v13.6.0 (AMMO, APPROVED ACTIONS, DSR & UP)

### Improvements

- SHIFT key is starting to be used to override certain automations/checks.
- Detect when an **Approved Action** has been performed by a stormknight - add a note to the Chat Card in such cases.
  - Note that an Approved Action won't be detected an attack if you roll from the skills list.
- Only allow the **UP** button to appear when the current Drama Card shows UP for the actor's faction. (This function can be disabled in the game settings.)
- Provide a warning message if the DSR button is pressed and the next step is not approved by the Drama card.
  - This warning can be bypassed by holding SHIFT while clicking on the DSR button.
- Ammunition - weapons remember which ammunition was selected for reloading (ammo name shown in BOLD at top of weapon's ammunition list).
  - Can change the ammunition type on the weapon's Sheet.
  - Add the damage and AP bonus from the loaded ammunition when attacking with that weapon.
- Ensure correct state of "play card" button state when hero is added to/removed from a combat.

- Display message to player if the "Done" (end turn) button can't find your combatant.
- Remove the heavy shadow from the journal page editor.

### Bug Fixes

## v13.5.0  (SURGE + DISCONNECTIONS)

### Improvements

- The **Good** and **Outstanding** fields of the powers sheet (Spells, Miracle, Psionic Powers) has been converted to an HTML field, so that inline enrichers such as `@Buff` can be used.
- Item control buttons are in same order on Stats tab and other tabs.
- Rework the `@Check` enricher, so that "dn=" can simply reference the target skill/attribute (without the 'target' prefix).
- Add `CONFIG.debug.torgtest` to provide console output for the Test processing.
- Add `CONFIG.debug.torgtestrender` to provide console output for the Test Reporting.
- Add new `@Damage[]` inline enricher.
  - `@Damage[shock=X|wounds=Y]` inflicts X shock and Y wounds to each selected token (either shock or wounds can be omitted)
  - `@Damage[damage=X]` inflicts X damage to the selected tokens, applying the target's toughness
    - `damage=X` can take some extra parameters:
    - `@Damage[damage=X|traits=fire]` inflicts X damage with the given attack Traits to the selected tokens, applying the target's toughness before calculating shock/wounds (currently the only supported traits are 'painful' and 'stagger')
    - `@Damage[damage=X|ap=Y]` apply Y amount of Armor Piercing when determining shock/wounds.
    - `@Damage[damage=X|ignoreArmor]` ignores the armor rating of the target when determining shock/wounds.
- Provide automation for the **Surge** Drama Conflict Line.
  - Each actor in the combat tracker on that faction's side will be examined for a possible contradiction, and a chat card will prompt with a dice roll for each actor. The 0, 1 or 1-4 cases are based on none, one or both of the following being true:
    - The actor's cosm does not match either of the cosms of the current scene.
    - Any item on the has a higher `Tech Level` (if set) or higher `secondary axiom` than the highest axioms of the cosms of the current scene (only taking 2nd cosm into account in a "mixed" zone).
- Provide automation for detecting **disconnection** during Test Checks.
- When **disconnected**, any items on the Actor which exceed the current scene's axioms will have a line drawn through the item's name (the system doesn't prevent the item from being used).
- A game system setting is available to disable automatically setting the Actor to disconnected on a Surge or Test check disconnection.
- Drama Card Line tooltip shows if current scene is `Standard` or `Dramatic`
- Report a **fragile item breaking** on a Mishap involving its use.

### Bug Fixes

- Popping out the Combat Tracker should show the correctly working drama card line.
- Adding a new Actor to an active Combat should set the correct initiative immediately.

  - **Confused** - disables the Play button in card Hands (until the end of the round).
  - **Fatigued** - when each player ends their turn (or GM presses end-turn-tick on the combatant) the character suffers their fatigue.

  - used async enrichment for description fields [#429](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/429)

  - Relocated where minStr and maxDex are stored to keep the partysheet clean [#433](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/433)

- A new option has been added to determine whether the details of the chat cards should be automatically expanded or not. [#420](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/420)
- Bug squishing and style issues:
  - In fatigue macro, there was some wierd thing going on with the Math.max method, so changed this. [#425](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/425)
  - For powers, the result of BDs were concated instead of added. Happend that test.damage was a string in this case. [#426](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/426)

## v. 12.1.1

- Hotfix for custom skills. These should work again. In their own special treatment ;)

## v. 12.1.0

- v12 compatibility is here! From now on, the system follows the foundry version in it's _major_ part of the version number.
- Broken links are no longer ugly placeholders, but a glowing effect on hovering remains to signal that there should be something there [#382](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/382)
- It is now possible to roll BDs and add damage in advance, using the dialog window [#123](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/123). From this work followed:

  - BDs on powers weren't shown on a chat card [#406](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/406)
  - More rolls are asynchronous (as it should've been since a long time and needed for V12)
  - Upstyling of the combat tracker

## v. 3.8.1

- Migration-correction
- Fixed minDex maxStr check by SKs/ Threats

## v. 3.8.0

- Perks now have the "Ground Sloth" & "Special / Homebrew" categories for your own needs, and adding a new box for general contradictions that will be displayed in the chat cards [#389](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/389)

- On Roll-dialogues, if a bonus number is entered into the previous roll field, the 'Input existing' radio button will now be automatically checked to support gameflow. [#384](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/384)
- By RAW, the DN on a multi target attack is the highest DN. This is now implemented- as well as an option to toggle that off for houserule purposses (as it was implemented until now).
- Processing now attributes no longer with `system.attributes.[attribute]`, but with `system.attributes.[attribute].base` (please **never** use this for change-purposses) and `system.attributes.[attribute].value` (this is the one you want to use). This ensures a safer handling with attribute scores that should not be affecting the ground value of the attribute. Therefore, the attributes now can only be altered by clicking the "Edit" button in the attribute fields. In case you're confused: The values of the fields are changing to their base value, not their current, modified value (if applicable).
- Bug- and stylefixes:
  - Style-Fix for vehicle addon item [#383](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/383)
  - Style-fix on general Chat-Cards holding item informations [#208](https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/issues/208)

- **HIGHLIGHT:** New option on attack dialogue for trademark weapon's (and similiar) mechanic.

## v. 3.3.0

- If a Storm Knight is deleted, the appropriate hand will be deleted as well.
- The combat tracker now behaves like it should for TE: All players now have the "Done" button displayed. If a player
  clicks it, the GM's combat tracker will be updated with a checked checkmark at the apropriate character. However, to
  end the round is totally up to the GM.
- New possibilities by cosm window! Click on "Possibilities" on your character sheet, a new window will open to help
  keeping you track of cosm-specific possibilities. Players can hit the key "P", as this bound for opening this window
  as well. If the apropriate premium module is active, clicking the title of the cosm-possibility will open the journal
  entry for quick rule reference. **PLEASE NOTE:** This won't have any impact on the system's behaviour, it's just for
  your convenience for accounting purposses.

  - If you are about to spend your last possibility, you're asked if you're really sure about that. At last, you could
    need it otherwise...

  - However, if a GM wants to grand you a possibility (there are moments, when heroes are needed!), the GM can click on
    "Possibility" on your chat card to produce a possibility roll

  - If on a scene are the cosms "None", "Other" or "Nile Empire" set, the mechanics for the law of action are principle
    possible to trigger. This means that you can click on "Possibility" twice, and the best result is chosen. We decided
    to take the "None" and "Other" cosm choice to be placed in this mechanics as well for GMs who are more playing a
    theatre of mind or don't want to configure cosms on their scenes.
- CusomSkills are now "favorable".

## v. 0.92.1

Various bug fixes and some additional UI enhancements. Added data structure to some items and reorganized some of the
item windows to accommodate additional data structure. Added ability to track ammo by treating ammo as a resource
(current/max). NOTE: sorry, everyone, but you are going to lose the data in your ammo field in existing weapons sheets.
You'll need to re-input the max ammo for any existing items. We will try to avoid doing this much, if any, in the
future.

Updated appearance of journal entry windows.

Known issue: some sheets that were created with a VERY early version of the system may display the attributes window
improperly on the Storm Knight sheet. We haven't tried to fix this because we assume there aren't many sheets like that
floating around out there. But if it is an issue for you, let us know. We can fix it.

## v. 0.92.0

Major user interface update! We have completely revamped all of the sheets (thanks much to @rwanoux for all his hard
work to get this done!).

NOTES FOR v. 0.91.0 We have added support for active effects! These effects are available for each Storm Knight and for
any items attached to Storm Knights. Active effects allow you to modify the base statistics for Storm Knights. They are
most useful for adding armor and defenses, but can also be used to modify skill values, attributes, and other related
statistics. To apply an active effect from an item (such as a piece of armor), create or edit the armor from the items
tab and add a passive effect that mirrors the abilities of the item. Then, drag and drop it onto the chracter sheet
(note that Foundry does not currently support editing active effects within items once they are attached to a character,
but you can still edit the effect on the character's "Effects" tab). For a list of Storm Knight statistics that can be
modified, see https://github.com/gmmatt/torgeternity/wiki/Storm-Knight-Data-Elements.
