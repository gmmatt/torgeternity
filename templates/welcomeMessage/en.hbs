    <h3>Beside of all the necessary features to bring the game experience from the table to the screen, the TORG
      Eternity System also provides the following compendiums:</h3>
    <ul class="flexcol">
      <li><a class="compendium systemRules" data-action="openPack" data-pack-name="torgeternity.basic-rules">Basic
          Rules</a> contains quickstart rules, Foundry specific explanations and a list of Effect commands.</li>
      <li><a class="compendium systemArchetypes" data-action="openPack"
          data-pack-name="torgeternity.archetypes">Archetypes</a>, which contains the 16 iconic Storm Knights as ready
        to
        play characters.</li>
      <li><a class="compendium systemHandouts" data-action="openPack"
          data-pack-name="torgeternity.handouts">Handouts</a>, which contains shareable handouts for the iconic
        Archetypes.</li>
      <li><a class="compendium systemCards" data-action="openPack" data-pack-name="torgeternity.core-card-set">Core Card
          Set</a>, which contains the complete core card deck. It will be imported automatically and integrates the
        drama deck with the combat tracker. The Cosm modules include their Card expansions that can simply be added to
        the core decks or be replaced.</li>
      <li><a class="compendium systemScenes" data-action="openPack" data-pack-name="torgeternity.core-scenes">Main
          Scene</a>, which contains the TORG background as a generic Landing Page which will be imported with the first
        launch of the world.</li>

    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>Many thanks to @rwanoux for his amazing work on this project. This system would not look as fantastic as it does
      without his contributions. The project would also not have realized its potential without the Torg Eternity
      community on Foundry. There are too many people to mention individually, but I especially want to give a shout-out
      to @Manuel, @Orome, @Paul Emerson, @Markus Raab, and @ForjaSalvaje for their contributions, input, and
      encouragement. -GM Matt (December 2021)</p>
    <p>I like to thank Helmut, BadIdeasBureau and Durak for their contributions, and Matt
      for being the first Chief o.D. - Algor</p>
